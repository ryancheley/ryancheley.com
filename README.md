This is the GitHub repo I use for my personal site. It currently runs on [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/). It started life as a WordPress blog, but I had some time in 2020, so I converted it to something Python related.

I use [echofeed](https://echofeed.app/) to post my new articles to my [Mastadon](https://mastodon.social/@ryancheley) feed automatically
