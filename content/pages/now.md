Title: Now

I'm currently winding down my 'Spring of Transition' [Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE). I chose this theme because my daughter has turned 18 and graduated High School so my wife and I will be [Empty Nesters](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empty%20nester) in August.

This has allowed me to focus more on spending time with my daughter while I can, and prepare for the next stage in life with my wife.
