I'm Ryan Cheley and this is my site. I've got various places on the internet you can find me, like [GitHub](https://github.com/ryancheley), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ryancheley), and [here](/)!

I like writing [Python](https://www.python.org), and when developing web stuff, I like to use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com). A couple of Django projects I've done can be found [here](https://stadiatracker.com/Pages/home) and [here](https://doestatisjrhaveanerrortoday.com).
