Signing up for the actual exam may have been the most difficult and confusing part. I had to be verified as someone that could take the test, and then my membership needed to be verified (or something).

I received my confirmation email that I could sign up for the exam and read through it to make sure I understood everything. Turns out, when you sign up for the CPHIMS you need to use your FULL name (and I had just used my middle and last name).

One email to the HIMSS people and we’re all set (need to remember that for next time ... this exam is the real deal!)

I was going to be in Oceanside for the Fourth of July Holiday and decided to sign up to take the exam in San Diego on the fifth. With a test date in hand I started on my study plan.

Every night when I got home I would spend roughly 45 minutes reading the study book, and going over Flash Cards that I had made with topics that I didn’t understand. Some nights I took off, but it was a solid 35 days of studying for 45 minutes.

Now, 2 things I did not consider:

1.  Scheduling an exam on the fifth is a little like scheduling an exam on Jan 1 ... not the best idea in the world
2.  The place my family and I go to in Oceanside always has a ton of friends and family for the weekend (30+) and it would be a less than ideal place to do any last minute studying / cramming

I spent some of the preceding weekend reading and reviewing flash cards, but once the full retinue of friends and family arrived it was pretty much over. I had some chances to read on the beach, but for the most part my studying stopped.

The morning of the fifth came. I made the 40 minutes drive from Oceanside to the testing center to take the CPHIMS exam for real.
