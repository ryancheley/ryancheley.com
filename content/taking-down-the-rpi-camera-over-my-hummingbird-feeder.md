As the temperature heats up itâ€™s time to take down my hummingbird feeder. While the winds have cooled down the valley for the last few days, 100+ days are slowly creeping in and I need to take it down before the CPU melts.

When I took it down last year I though, meh, how hard could it be to put back up. And then I put it back up in the Fall last year and had nothing but problems.

This year, I wanted to document the wires and what not so that I can just put it back up once the temps cool down outside.

Anyway, I could describe it or just take some pictures ... so here are some pictures for when I need to set it up again later this year.

Wires to the sensor:

Wires to the GPIO pins:
