I'm in Orlando for [HIMSS17](http://www.himssconference.org) and and pretty pumped for my day one session tomorrow which is titled: Business Intelligence Best Practices: A Strong Foundation for Organizational Success.

Conferences are always a bit overwhelming, but this one is more overwhelming than most. More than 40,000 people all gathered in one convention center to discuss Healthcare Tech. Kind of awesome and scary!

I'm looking forward to visiting some booths in the exhibition hall, and wandering around and stumbling onto some great new things / ideas.

I'm going to write up my impressions of the days events, hopefully including notes, and links to tweets because the tweets will be raw and most uncensored impressions of what I'm seeing / hearing.

Here's the HIMSS 2017!
