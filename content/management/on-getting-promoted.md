Earlier this month I was promoted to the role of Associate Vice President at work. This was a thrill for me professionally and personally. I've been with my current employer for more than 16 years, and honestly, I can't imagine working anywhere else. That's not to say that every day has been rainbows and unicorns ... it most definitely has not been. But there have been (way) more good days than bad days, and I believe that the work I do matters. 

This new role brings with it a lot more responsibility and much higher expectations ... and more stress. My graying hair is only going to get grayer! 

But what I really want to focus on is how I got here. Because while it's easy to say **I** was promoted to the role of AVP, that really doesn't acknowledge, and appreciate, the people that helped me to get here. And there were many!

I can broadly categorize these people into

- Communities
- Friends
- Mentors
- Family
- Luck

## Community

The communities that we belong to impact and influence us in ways that are hard to appreciate. I've been involved in many communities over the last 16 years, both at work and outside of work. The one community that I think has impacted me the most with this promotion is the Django community.

I was first exposed to Django in 2018. When I heard about DjangoCon US and saw that it was in San Diego (only a 2.5 hour drive for me) I decided I was going to go. I was all ready to buy my ticket, get my hotel room, and take some PTO to go when suddenly I had a work conference at the same time. A similar thing happened in 2019. And then 2020 happened. 

I did finally make my way to the virtual DjangoCon US in 2021, and attended the in person events since 2022. I've met some amazing people and saw the way that the community works together on keeping Django sustainable. I've seen how people work together, disagree, and agree in ways that help to move the project together. 

It's not hyperbole to say that this had a major influence on the way that I tried to run the department I was the head of. It's impacted the way I think about the technology I work with, it's long term maintenance, documentation, sustainability ... honestly every aspect of the tech I work with now has been directly impacted by what I see in the Django Community. It has made me a better technical leader. It has made me a better human too. And the funniest part is that the amount of Python or Django I work with at my day job is probably less than 5%. But it's influence is large

## Friends

It's been said that you are the average of the 5 people you hang out with most often and I think that's true ... for me at least. The last 5 years have been a strange thing when it comes to hanging out with people, but the friends I've been able to hang out with have kept me grounded. They've all been excited or proud for me when I've been promoted, but they've also been the first ones to help remind me where I came from. I consider myself extremely lucky to have a group of long term friends that can call me on my bull shit when I need it. 

## Mentors

I've been lucky with the mentors I've had over my career. Some have been bosses, others have been colleagues. Yet others have come from professional associations I've been a member of. Each one of them had something to offer to me. A bit of advice when dealing with a challenging situation. Feedback from a meeting we were both at where I did something well, or could have done something better. 

Finding a dediceted mentor isn't necessary, but it can be helpful. If you don't have a specific mentoring program where you work, try to find informal ones. They can make all of the difference. 

## Family

The most important people in my journey though would honestly be my wife and daughter. My wife helped prop me up on the 'bad' days that were really bad. She helped remind me why what I do is important when I forget. She is the rock on which I depend in ways that I don't always even realize. She is the biggest reason I'm where I am. I could not have done this without her. 

My daughter also had an undue influence on getting me here. When she was small it was to make sure I could provide a good life for her. As she grew up she reminded me to enjoy the journey. And although she doesn't know it, she helped me to realize that work will still be there tomrorow, and there are things more important than work (like a dance recital!). 

## Luck

All of this is to say that while I was promoted, it's all of the people in my life that helped to get me here. However, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that luck also played a big role in me being where I am. 

I'm a middle aged, cis white dude. I'm basically playing life on easy mode, and I really want to acknowledge that privelage. How I got here wasn't easy, but it was probably easier for me than it would have been where I not in the demographic I'm in. 

So it's with this luck that I look around and see all of the things that I'd like to make better in the ways that I can. I see some of the technical team in my department and really worry that all of the members of this team, or that team, are all dudes. I worry that I'm not doing enough to try and help gender diversity in the hiring of my teams. I would rather have a much more diverse workforce, because honestly I've seen some great things come from that. 

It's the teams of totally homogenous developers that deliver solutions that don't always add value in the ways that these solutions need to. 

I want to change that. I'm working to change that, but it's not always as easy, or fast, as I think and wish it were. 

I was lucky to get here, but I also had a great support system around me that allowed me to get here. 

So yes, I was promoted, but only because of the amazing group of people I was lucky enough to be surrounded by.
