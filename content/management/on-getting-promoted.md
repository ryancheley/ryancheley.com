Earlier this month I was promoted to the role of Associate Vice President at work. This was a thrill for me professionally and personally. I've been with my current employer for more than 16 years, and honestly, I can't imagine working anywhere else. That's not to say that every day has been rainbows and unicorns ... it most definitely has not been. But there have been (way) more good days than bad days, and I believe that the work I do matters. 

This new role brings with it a lot more responsibility and much higher expectations ... and more stress. My graying hair is only going to get grayer! 

But what I really want to focus on is how I got here. Because while it's easy to say **I** was promoted to the role of AVP, that really doesn't acknowledge, and appreciate, the people that helped me to get here. And there were many!

I've had some great mentors over the years that have provided sage advice, and given counsel on how best to deal with specific situations, and more general situations. It's hard to enumerate all of them, and if I did, I'm sure I'd miss at least a few. But I'm going to do my best:

- Tim Gibbs
- Dr. Edith Jones-Poland
- Lauren Beyeler
- Dr. Michael Griffis
- Tom Rancilio
- Colin Robertson
- Brian Hodgkins
- Zack Sanabia

## Community

In 2018 I really wanted to go to DjangoCon US in San Diego. I had a hard time figuring out how I'd be able to go, and just when I did I found out there was a work conference I needed to go to. 

Then I tried again in 2019 and the same work conference got in the way. 

So 2020 was going to be THE YEAR I finally made it ... and we all know how that went. 

Finally in 2021 I made to the online version, and in 2022 I was live and in person. Getting to meet so many new, and awesome people. I learned more and more about the Django community and saw how it thought about the project 'Django'. Both the technical aspects, but maybe more importantly, the people aspects. 

I can't even begin to describe how much this impacted the way I think about the technology I work with, it's long term maintenance, documentation, sustainability ... honestly every aspect of the tech I work with now has been directly impacted by what I see in the Django Community. It has made me a better technical leader. It has made me a better human too. 

## Personal

The most important people in my journey though would honestly be my wife and daughter. My wife helped prop me up on the 'bad' days that were really bad. She
