I've gone through all of my notes, reviewed all of the presentations and am feeling really good about my experience at HIMSS.

Takeaways:

1.  We need to get ADT enabled for the local hospitals
2.  We need to have a governance system set up for a variety of things, including data, reporting, and IT based projects

Below are the educational sessions (in no particular order) I attended and my impressions. Mostly a collection of *interesting* facts (I've left the Calls to Action for my to do list).

**Choosing the Right IT Projects to Deliver Strategic Value** presented by [Tom Selva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-selva-49207351) and [Seth Katz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethjeremykatz) they really hit home the idea that there is a relationship between culture and governance. The culture of the organization has to be ready to accept the accountability that will come with governance. They also indicated that process is the most important part of governance. Without process you **CANNOT** have governance.

In addition to great advice, they had great implementation strategies including the idea of requiring all IT projects to have an elevator pitch and a more formal 10 minute presentation on why the project should be done and in what way it aligned with the strategy of the organization.

**Semantic data analysis for interoperability** presented by [Richard E. Biehl, Ph.D.](http://iems.ucf.edu/mshse) showed me that there was an aspect of data that I hadn't ever had to think about. What to do when multiple systems are brought together and define the same word or concept in different ways. Specifically,, "Semantic challenge is the idea of a shared meaning or the data that is shared". The example on relating the concept of a migraine from ICD to SNOMED and how they can result in mutually exclusive definitions of the same 'idea' was something I hadn't ever really considered before.

**Next Generation IT Governance: Fully-Integrated and Operationally-Led** presented by [Ryan Bosch, MD, MBAEHS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-bosch-md-46b921) and [Fran Turisco, MBA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fran-turisco-015096a) hit home the idea of **Begin with the End in mind**. If you know where you're going it's much easier to know *how* to get there. This is something I've always instinctively felt, however, distilling it to this short, easy to remember statement was really powerful for me.

**Developing a “Need-Based” Population Management System** presented by  
Rick Lang and [Tim Hediger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-hediger-a1765) hammered home the idea that "Collaboration and Partnering are KEY to success". Again, something that I *know* but it's always nice to hear it out loud.

**Machine Intelligence for Reducing Clinical Variation** presented by [Todd Stewart, MD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowland-todd-stewart-md-7a85b6b) and [F.X. Campion, MD, FACP](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francis-campion-b3a8047) was one of the more technical sessions I attended. They spoke about how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning don't replace normal analysis, but instead allow us to focus on what hypothesis we should test in the first place. They also introduced the idea (to me anyway) that data has *shape* and that *shape* can be analyzed to lead to insight. They also spoke about 'Topological Data Analysis' which is something I want to learn more about.

**Driving Patient Engagement through mobile care management** presented by [Susan Beaton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-beaton-7848071b) spoke about using *Health Coaches* to help patients learn to implement parts of the care plan. They also spoke about how "Mobile engagement can lead to increased feeling of control for members" These are aspects that I'd like to see my organization look to implement in the coming months / years

**Expanding Real time notifications for care transitions** presented by  
[Elaine Fontaine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-fontaine-3b68144) spoke about using demographic data to determine the best discharge plan for the patient. In one of the presentations I saw (Connecticut Hospitals Drive Policy with Geospatial Analysis presented by Pat Charmel) the presenter had indicated that as much as 60% of healthcare costs are determined by demographics. If we can keep this in mind we can help control healthcare costs much more effectively, but it lead me to ask:

-   how much do we know
-   how much can we know
-   what aspects of privacy do we need to think about before embarking on such a path?

**Your Turn: Data Quality and Integrity** which was more of an interactive session when asked the question "What would a National Patient Identifier be useful for?" most attendees in audience felt that it would help with information sharing

**Predictive Analytics: A Foundation for Care Management** presented by [Jessica Taylor, RN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-taylor-56039864) and Amber Sloat, RN I saw that while California has been thinking about and preparing for value based care for some time, the rest of the country is just coming around to the idea. The hospital that these Nurses work for are doing some very innovative things, but they're things that we've been doing for years. The one thing they did seem to have that we don't is an active HIE that helps to keep track of patients in near real time. I would love to have! One of the benefits of a smaller state perhaps (they were from Maine)?

**A model of data maturity to support predictive analytics** presented by [Daniel O’Malley, MS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-o-malley-49995b8) was full of lots of charts and diagrams on what the University of Virginia was doing, but it was short on how they got there. I would have liked to have seen more information on roadblocks that they encountered during each of the stages of the maturity. That being said, because the presentation has the charts and diagrams, I feel like I'll be able to get something out of the talk that will help back at work.

**Emerging Impacts on Artificial Intelligence on Healthcare IT** presented by [James Golden, Ph.D.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jigolden) and Christopher Ross, MBA. They had a statistic that 30% of all data in the world is healthcare data! That was simply amazing to me. They also had data showing that medical knowledge doubles every THREE years. This means that between the time you started medical school and the time you were a full fledged doctor the amount of medical knowledge could have increased 4 to 8 fold! How can anyone keep up with that kind of knowledge growth? The simple answer is that they can't and that's why AI and ML are so important for medicine. But equally important is how the AI/ML are trained.
