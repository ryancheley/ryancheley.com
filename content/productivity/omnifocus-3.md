The OmniGroup [posted on their blog the other day](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omnifocus-3.0-for-ios-ship-date-may-30) that they have a ship date for OmniFocus 3 â€¦ May 30.

To say that Iâ€™m excited is a bit of an understatement. Iâ€™ve been a loyal OmniFocus user for about 5 years now, and though [I have declared OmniFocus bankruptcy once](/declaring-omnifocus-bankrupty.html), I still believe itâ€™s a super useful App and I could not imagine life without it.

OmniFocus3 will bring with it tags which is something Iâ€™ve really wanted and struggled without in using OmniFocus2. Sometimes things donâ€™t just fall into pure GTD contexts and tags appear to be a recognition of that.

The initial release on May 30 is iOS only. The Mac Version is set to be released in 2018 but no firm date has been announced.

Only 25 days until upgrade day ðŸ˜Š
