Hello, I'm Ryan Cheley and I've decided to stand for the Django 6.x Steering Council.

My journey with the Django community began in March 2022 when I started contributing pull requests to DjangoPackages. My initial contributions quickly led to deeper involvement, and I was grateful and honored to be asked to be a maintainer following DjangoCon US 2022.

At the DjangoCon US 2022 Sprints, I worked on a SQLite-related bug in Django's ORM. This proved so valuable that I was was able to give a talk about my experience at DjangoCon US 2023, where I delivered my talk "Contributing to Django or How I learned to stop worrying and just try to fix a bug in the ORM".

Building on this experience, I returned to DCUS 2024 to present on "Error Culture" where I took a deep dive into the widespread but often overlooked issue of how organizations manage error alerts in technology and programming domains.

My commitment to the Django ecosystem extends beyond code contributions. I've served as a Navigator for two sessions of Djangonaut Space, helping guide newcomers through their first contributions to Django. This role has allowed me to give back to the community while developing my mentorship skills.

As one of the admins for Django Commons I work with some amazing folks to help provide an organization that works to improve the maintainer experience.

Additionally, I've made various contributions to Django Core, including both code improvements and documentation enhancements.

Throughout my involvement with Django, I've consistently shown a commitment to both technical excellence and community building. My experience spans coding, documentation, mentorship, and public speaking, reflecting my holistic approach to contributing to the Django ecosystem.

My focus will be in creating sustainable and inclusive leadership structures. This would, in turn, not only provide help and support for current Django leadership, but also develop and empower future leaders.

The avenues to meet these goals include gathering diverse candidates, providing mentorship opportunities, clearly communicating expectations, and removing financial barriers to participation.

As a member of the Django Steering Council (SC) for the 6.x series, I hope to be able to accomplish the following with my fellow SC Members:

- Establish a governance structure that allows the SC to be successful going forward by:
    - Providing Mentorship for future potential SC members from the Community
    - Reviewing the 18-month requirements for eligibility for SC
    - Communicating the expectations for SC role in Community
    - Working to increase the diversity of those that are willing and able to stand for the SC in the 7.x series and going forward
- Collaborate with Working Groups to
    - ease burden of fellows in a meaningful way via the Fellowship Working Group
    - work with Social Media Working Group to promote new or upcoming features
- Write up weekly / monthly reports, similar to the fellows reports
- Work with the Django Software Foundation(DSF) Board to establish a stipend for 7.x SC members going forward to support their work and allow more diverse participation
- Implement a road map for Django drawing input and inspiration from the Community, specifically from these sources

- Work on and complete a DEPs to
    - Remove Dead Batteries, similar to Python [PEP 594](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/)
    - Determine the long term viability of Trac, research alternatives, and come up with triggers that would lead to a migration if/when necessary.
- Review and approve or reject all current [draft DEPs](https://github.com/django/deps/tree/main/draft)

The Django community has done so much for me. I'm hoping that with my involvement on the Steering Council I'm able to work to do my part to ensure the long term success and viability of the Django community and leave it in a better place than I found it.
