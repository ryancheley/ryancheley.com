# My Experience at DjangoCon US 2023

A few days ago I returned from DjangoCon US 2023 and wow, what an amazing time. The only regret I have is that I didn't take very many pictures. This is something I will need to work on for next year.

On Monday October 16th I gave a talk [Contributing to Django or how I learned to stop worrying and just try to fix an ORM Bug](https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/contributing-to-django-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-just-try-to-fix-an-orm-bug/). The video will be posted on YouTube in a few weeks. This was the first tech conference I've ever spoken at!!!! I was super nervous leading up to the talk, and even a bit at the start, but once I got going I finally settled in.

Here's me on stage taking a selfie with the crowd behind me

Luckily, my talk was one of the first non-Keynote talks so I was able to relax and enjoy the conference while the rest of the time.

After the conference talks ended on Wednesday I stuck around for the sprints. This is such a great time to be able to work on open source projects (Django adjacent or not) and just generally hang out with other Djangonauts. I was able to do some work on DjangoPackages with Jeff Triplett, and just generally hang out with some truly amazing people.

The Django community is just so great. I've been to many conferences before, but this one is the first where I feel like I belong.

I am having some of those post conference blues, but thankfully Kojo Idrissa wrote something about how to [help with that](https://kojoidrissa.com/conferences/community/pycon%20africa/noramgt/2019/08/11/post_conference_depression.html). And taking his advice, it has been helpful to come down from the Conference high.

Although the location of DjangoCon US 2024 hasn't been announced yet, I'm making plans to attend.

I am also setting myself some goals to have completed by the start of DCUS 2024

- join the fundraising working group
- work on at least 1 code related ticket in Trac
- work on at least 1 doc related ticket in Trac
- have been part of a writing group with fellow Djangonauts and posted at least 1 article per month

I had a great experience speaking, and I **think** I'd like to do it again, but I'm still working through that.

It's a lot harder to give a talk than I thought it would be! That being said, I do have in my 'To Do' app a task to 'Brainstorm DjangoCon talk ideas' so we'll see if (1) I'm able to come up with anything, and (2) I have a talk accepted for 2024.
