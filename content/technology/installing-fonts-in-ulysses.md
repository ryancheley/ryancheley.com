One of the people I follow online, [Federico Viticci](http://ticci.org), is an iOS power user, although I would argue that phrase doesn’t really do him justice. He can make the iPad do things that many people can’t get Macs to do.

Recently he [posted](https://www.macstories.net/linked/in-search-of-the-perfect-writing-font/) an article on a new font he is using in Ulysses and I wanted to give it a try. The article says:

> > Installing custsom fonts in Ulysses for iOS is easy: [go to the GitHub page](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Duospace "iA Writer Duospace"), download each one, and open them in Ulysses (with the share sheet) to install them.

Simple enough, but it wasn’t clicking for me. I kept thinking I had done *something* wrong. So I thought I’d write up the steps I used so I wouldn’t forget the next time I need to add a new font.

## Downloading the Font

1.  Download the font to somewhere you can get it. I chose to save it to iCloud and use the `Files` app
2.  Hit Select in the `Files` app
3.  Click `Share`
4.  Select `Open in Ulysses`
5.  The custom font is now installed and being used.

## Checking the Font:

1.  Click the ‘A’ in the writing screen (this is the font selector) located in the upper right hand corner of Ulysses

![](/images/uploads/2017/12/Image.jpeg){.alignnone .size-full .wp-image-94 width="584" height="259"}

1.  Notice that the Current font indicates it’s a custom font (in This case iA Writer Duospace:

![](/images/uploads/2017/12/IMG_0025.jpg){.alignnone .size-full .wp-image-93 width="704" height="1279"}

Not that hard, but there’s no feedback telling you that you have been successful so I wasn’t sure if I had done it or not.
