From [Classy Class Based Views](http://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/2.2/django.views.generic.edit/DeleteView/) `DeleteView`

> > View for deleting an object retrieved with self.get*object(), with a  
> > *

response rendered by a template.

## Attributes

There are no new attributes, but 2 that weâ€™ve seen are required: (1) `queryset` or `model`; and (2) `success_url`

## Example

views.py

    class myDeleteView(DeleteView):
        queryset = Person.objects.all()
        success_url = reverse_lazy('rango:list_view')

urls.py

    path('delete_view/<int:pk>', views.myDeleteView.as_view(), name='delete_view'),

\<template_name\>.html

Below is just the form that would be needed to get the delete to work.

        <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
            <th>First Name</th>
            <th>Last Name</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>{{ person.first_name }}</td>
                <td>{{ person.last_name }}</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <div>
            <a href="{% url 'rango:list_view' %}">Back</a>
            <input type="submit" value="Delete">
        </div>
        </form>

## Conclusion

As far as implementations, the ability to add a form to delete data is about the easiest thing you can do in Django. It requires next to nothing in terms of implementing. We now have step 4 of a CRUD app!
