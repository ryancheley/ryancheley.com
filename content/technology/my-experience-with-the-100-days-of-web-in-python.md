As soon as I discovered the Talk Python to me Podcast, I discovered the Talk Python to me courses. Through my job I have a basically free subscription to PluralSight so I wasn’t sure that I needed to pay for the courses when I was effectively getting courses in Python for free.

After taking a couple ( well, truth be told, all ) of the Python courses at PluralSight, I decided, what the heck, the courses at Talk Python looked interesting, Michael Kennedy has a good instructor’s voice and is genuinely excited about Python, and if it didn’t work out, it didn’t work out.

I’m so glad I did, and I’m so glad I went through the 100 Days of Web in Python course.

On May 2, 2019 I saw that the course had been released and I [tweeted](https://mobile.twitter.com/ryancheley/status/1124127232262152192 "This!")

> > This x 1000000! Thank you so much \@TalkPython. I can’t wait to get started!

I started on the course on May 4, 2019 and completed it August 11, 2019. Full details on the course are [here](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/100-days-of-web-in-python "#100DaysOfWeb in Python").

Of the 28 concepts that were reviewed over the course, my favorites things were learning [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com "Django Project") and [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org "DRF") and [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com "Pelican"). Holy crap, those parts were just so much fun for me. Part of my interest in Django and DRF comes from [William S Vincent’s books](https://wsvincent.com/books/ "Will Vincent Books") and Podcast [Django Chat](https://djangochat.com "Django Chat"), but having actual videos to watch to get me through some of the things that have been conceptually tougher for me was a godsend.

The other part that I really liked was actual deployment to a server. I had tried (about 16 months ago) to deploy a Django app to Digital Ocean and it was an unmitigated disaster. No static files no matter what I did. I eventually gave up.

In this course I really learned how to deploy to both [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com "Heroku") and a Linux box on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com "Digital Ocean"), and so now I feel much more confident that the app I’m working on (more on that below) will actually see the light of day on something other than a dev machine!

The one thing that I started to build (and am continuing to work on) is an app with a DRF backend and a Vue.js front end that allows a user to track which Baseball [stadia](https://www.writing-skills.com/is-it-stadia-or-stadiums "I’m going with the proper Latin pluralization because I’m fancy like that") they’ve been to. So far I have an API set up via DRF (hosted at Heroku) and sketches of what to do in Vue.js. There's also a Django front end (but it’s not the solution I really want to use).

Writing code for 100 days is hard. Like really hard. For nearly 20 of those days I was on a family vacation in the Mid Western part of the US, but I made time for both the coding, and my family. My family was super supportive of my goal which was helpful, but the content in the course was really interesting and challenging and made me want to do it every day, which was also super helpful.

On day 85 I got a video from Bob that helped get me through the last 2 weeks. It was encouraging, and helpful which is just what I needed. So thank you Bob.

At the end I also got a nice [congratulatory video](https://www.bonjoro.com/g/Wveg23mstaE) from Julian, which was surprising to say the least, especially because he called out some of the things that I tweeted that I enjoyed about the class, addressed me by name, and just genuinely made me feel good about my accomplishment!

OK. I just wrapped up the 100 Days of Code with Python and the web. Now what?

I took a week off to recuperate and am now ready to ‘get back to it’.

After all, I’ve got baseball stadia to track in my app!
