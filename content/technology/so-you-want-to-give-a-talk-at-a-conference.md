Last October I gave my first honest to goodness, on my own, up on the stage by myself talk at a tech conference. It was the most stressful yet fulfilling professional experience I've had.

Fulfilling in that I've wanted to get better at speaking in public and this helped in that goal.

Stressful in that I really wanted to do a good job and wasn't sure that I could, or worse, that anyone would care about what I had to say.

Well, neither of those things turned out to be true. I did get a lot of good feedback which tells me I did a good job, and people were very encouraging for the words that I had to say, so people did care.

My presentation went so well that I was even [interviewed by Jay Miller](https://youtu.be/WkeRI7LkBeY?si=gIgeMODD3aQJsfvX).

You can see my actual talk [here](https://youtu.be/VPldDxuJDsg?si=r2ob3j4zIeYZY7tO), but I thought it would also be interesting for you to see how I got here.

## Submitting the idea

I submitted my talk idea for DCUS 2023 in May and it was selected in June. That gave me roughly 3 months to get my loose outline of an idea into a 45 minute talk.

## Brain storming how the talk would go

I have tried to get a better workflow for brainstorming ideas in general, but I really wanted to up my game for this talk. To that end I used the [Story Teller Tactics](https://pipdecks.com/pages/storyteller-tactics-card-deck) cards to help determine the path of the story I would tell in my presentation.

That helped when I got to mind mapping[ref]I use MindNode for mind mapping, mostly on my iPad[/ref] my talk.

The use of the Story Teller Tactics, combined with my mind map, lead to a starting point for creating my presentation

## My 'Oh Sh%t moment'

Back in early July I was browsing Mastodon (instead of working on my presentation) and came across a link to an article with the title [How To Become A Better Speaker At Conferences](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/07/become-better-speaker-conferences/). I saved it to my read it later service and went on browsing. A few weeks later I actually read the article (around July 25).

This bit of advice got me a little worried:

>  On a practical level, a 45-minute talk can take a **surprisingly long time to put together**. I reckon it takes me at least an hour of preparation for every minute of content.

Yikes! That means I would need to prepare and rehearse and prepare for 45 hours over the course of 14 weeks (almost 4 hours per week on average). So I set up a schedule for how I would meet this requirement

## Working on the presentation

I spent all of August and the early part of September working on my presentation for about 3 hours a week. Adding slight tweaks to it here and there. I conducted a dry run with my team at work to assess my presentation's progress.

The dry run went *fine*, but it was clear that my presentation was missing *something*.

### Asking for feedback

Django Con offers up mentors to help you work on your talk. If you're newer to giving presentations, I **highly** recommend engaging with one of them. The feedback they provide is priceless!

I had the great fortune to reach out to [Katie McLaughlin](https://cloudisland.nz/@glasnt) who had just given a talk at PyCon Australia titled [Present Like a Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMcx35RGzYM). I watched that before reaching out to her and she gave some very good advice on presentation.


### Getting serious about preparing for the talk

As I said, I had done a dry run with my team at work and it was *fine* but I could tell that the way I was working on my presentation wasn't getting it to where I wanted it to be. So I decided to go all in on practicing and trying to make it the best I could. In order to accomplish that I believe I would need to engage in **deliberate** practice by actually giving my presentation. This was a breakthrough moment for me in improving the presentation and my deliver of it.

In order to have deliberate practice I set up the following routine:

1. Give my presentation and RECORD it
2. Watch my presentation and make notes about what needed to be improved
3. Update my presentation based on the notes from #2
4. Go back to step 1

Steps 1 - 3 were done on different days. For example, on Monday I would record me giving the presentation; on Tuesday I would watch the presentation and make notes; on Wednesday I would update the presentation based on my notes from Tuesday; on Thursday I would start over.

I did this a total of **7** times over 21 days. Two of these times when giving the presentation I gave it to a 'live' audience and was able to get feedback from them on various parts of the presentation.

I did one final dry run on October 13th (the Friday before my presentation was to happen for *real*)

That Friday was the *last* time I even looked at my presentation before giving it. I know some people will talk about making updates on the plane ride to the conference, or the night before, or the hour before, but that would stress the crap out of me, and I was already stressed out enough!

## Giving my talk for Real

On Monday October 16th I gave my talk in front of people, in real life, for the first time. Here I am up on stage with the crowd in the background

All in all it was a really fulfilling experience, but it was pretty hard too. This was the *first* time I spoke at a Tech Conference and I really wanted to do well.

As I said before, I received some really good feedback on the talk and I was really glad to have done it.

Now, you might ask, "Would I have to go to all of this trouble to prepare for a talk?"

Maybe, maybe not. I just happened to find this particular prep process worked well for my brain.

It was nice to hear from some of the attendees surprised that my talk was the first honest to goodness talk on my own I had ever given because it sounded so polished and well done.

Practice makes better, and in this case (based on the videos) it sure did for me

## A Big Thank you

A presentation like this took a lot out of me, but I am extremely grateful to a few people in particular:

* [Katie McLaughlin](https://cloudisland.nz/@glasnt)
* The Team of Web Developers at work
  * Bookie
  * Chris
  * Jason
  * Jon
* My daughter Abigail

## A little bit extra

If you want to see more details on my talk, here is a [playlist of the dry run attempts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMHsf-A9W6iXadPsvD-7Efqo860LpFpxP) I did to prepare[ref]Be careful, there is at least one not-safe-for-work word in one of the early videos.[/ref]

If you want to see the repo where the changes were tracked for my presentation it can be found [here](https://github.com/ryancheley/djangocon-us-2023)


## Time tracking

I time track the crap out of my work day, and I *really* wish I would have done that here just to get a more exact idea of how much time I spent preparing, but some basic back of the envelope math gives me nearly 56 hours of prep for this. One thing I do religiously for work is track my time. I do this for a couple of reasons, but for some reason, I didn't do that as I prepared for my talk here. The time I have here is mostly estimates based on my memory (which could be wildly over stated, or understated).


| Activity | Time Spent |
| --- | --- |
| Story Teller Tactics Work | 1.5 Hours |
| Mind Mapping Talk | 3 hours |
| Initial Draft of Presentation    | 5 Hours |
| Presentation Updates | 18 Hours |
| Deliberate Practice | 28 Hours |
| **Total Time** | **55.5 hours** |
