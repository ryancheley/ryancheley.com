For Christmas I bought myself a 2017 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Several bonuses were associated with the purchase:

1.  A \$150 Apple Gift Card because I bought the MacBook Pro on Black Friday and Apple had a special going (w00t!)
2.  The Credit Card I use to make **ALL** of my purchases at Apple has a 3% cash back (in the form of iTunes cards)
3.  A free 30 minute online / phone session with an ‘Apple Specialist’

Now I didn’t know about item number 3 when I made the purchase, but was greeted with an email informing me of my great luck.

This is my fifth Mac[ref]They are in order of purchase: 2012 15-inch MacBook Pro, 2014 27-inch 5K iMac, 2015 MacBook, 2016 13-inch 2 Thunderbolt MacBook Pro; 2017 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar[/ref] and I don’t remember ever getting this kind of service before. So I figured, what the hell and decided to snooze the email until the day after Christmas to remind myself to sign up for the session.

When I entered the session I was asked to optionally provide some information about myself. I indicated that I had been using a Mac for several years and considered myself an intermediate user.

My Apple ‘Specialist’ was *[Jaime](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jaime_Lannister "No ... not that one")*. She confirmed the optional notes that I entered and we were off to the races.

Now a lot of what she told me about Safari (blocking creepy tracking behavior, ability to mute sound from auto play videos, default site to display in reader view) I knew from the [WWDC Keynote](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/101/ "WWDC Keynote") that I watched back in June, but I listened just in case I had missed something from that session (or the [10s / 100s of hours of podcasts](https://relay.fm "All the Great Shows!") I listened to about the Keynote).

One thing that I had heard about was the ability to *pin* tabs in Safari. I never really knew what that meant and figured it wasn’t anything that I needed.

I was wrong. Holy crap is [pinning tabs in Safari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ssw5MKAno "Pinning Tabs!") a useful feature! I can keep all of my most used sites pinned and get to them really quickly and they get auto refreshed! Sweet!

The other super useful thing I found out about was the [Split Screen](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948 "Split your screen ... increase your productivity") feature that allows you to split apps on your screen (in a very iOS-y way!).

Finally, Jaime reviewed how to customize the touch bar! This one was super useful as I think there are 2 discoverability issues with it:

1.  The option to `Customize Touch Bar` is hidden in the `View` menu which isn’t somewhere I’d look for it
2.  To [Customize the Touch Bar](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207055 "Customization!") you drag down from the Main Screen onto the Touch Bar.

After the call I received a nice follow up email from Apple / Jaime

I’m glad that I had the Mac session and I will encourage anyone that buys a Mac in the future to schedule one.
