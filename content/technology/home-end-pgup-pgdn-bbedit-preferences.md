As I've been writing up my posts for the last couple of days I've been using the amazing [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_operating_systems) [Text Editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html). One of the things that has been tripping me up though are my 'Windows' tendencies on the keyboard. Specifically, my muscle memory of the use and behavior of the `Home`, `End`, `PgUp` and `PgDn` keys. The default behavior for these keys in BBEdit are not what I needed (nor wanted). I lived with it for a couple of days figuring I'd get used to it and that would be that.

While driving home from work today I was listening to [ATP Episode 196](https://atp.fm/episodes/196) and their Post-Show discussion of the recent departure of [Sal Soghoian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal_Soghoian) who was the Project Manager for the macOS automation. I'm not sure why, but suddenly it clicked with me that I could probably change the behavior of the keys through the Preferences for the Keyboard (either system wide, or just in the Application).

When I got home I fired up [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) and jumped into the preferences and saw this:

I made a couple of changes, and now the keys that I use to navigate through the text editor are now how I want them to be:

Nothing too fancy, or anything, but goodness, does it feel right to have the keys work the way I need them to.
