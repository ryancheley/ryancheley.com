I have many meetings that I go to in any given day. One of the things that I’d been struggling with was being able to keep track of what I needed to do after a meeting and/or documenting certain types of meetings more effectively.

I have been using a Workflow I created a couple of years ago to get the pertinent details of a meeting into Drafts. I spoke about updating that workflow to incorporate drafts 5 [here](/updating-my-meeting-workflow-for-drafts-5/ "Drafts 5!").

Once I was able to get the information into Drafts 5 a new opportunity arose. I was able to run a Workflow in Drafts!

I decided that getting the information into Drafts was great, but I needed a good way to get it out.

There were two sections in the Draft that I decided I could leverage to help:

1.  Actions
2.  Notes

Broadly speaking there are 3 types of meetings I go to:

1.  Daily Standup aka Scrum
2.  One-on-One with direct reports or my manager
3.  General Meetings

Categorizing the meetings helped me to create Draft Actions that run Workflows for each meeting type.

## Scrum

This workflow runs through the `Actions` of the Draft and adds each one to OmniFocus in a Project called `Scrum` with a Tag of `Work`. The due date set for these tasks is noon of the same day. My goal is to have the items that come from Scrum totally processed by noon of that day and for 80% of them I can. Some actions are more involved, but having them in OmniFocus helps me to make sure that they get taken care of.

It also creates a calendar meeting for the next business day with my Scrum template and lets me know which team member will start that next day.

## One-on-One

This workflow runs similarly to the Scrum workflow. It adds the `Action` items to OmniFocus with a due date of noon the same day, tagged with Work and in the One-on-One Project.

Instead of creating a calendar meeting for the next business day at 8:30 it appends items from the `Notes` section to a Dropbox file. The Dropbox path is predefined, but the name of the file matches the name of the person I met with (luckily I don’t have 2 Tom’s reporting to me).

## General Meetings

This is the simplest workflow. It adds all of the items under actions to OmniFocus with a due date of noon, project of Meeting Follow Up and Tag of Work.

After the Actions are run from Drafts the notes are archived in Drafts.

I’m toying with the idea of archiving the notes from these meetings into Dropbox, but I’m not sure that it gets me anything ... so I haven’t really looked at it too deeply.
