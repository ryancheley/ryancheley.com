I went out of town to watch the Firebirds play today and it was a great time. The 2+ hour trip down was mostly uneventful, but we did have to avoid some traffic going through some backroads that none of us had ever taken before. I think one of the best things about going out of town to a city is being able to park my car at the hotel and then NEVER have to drive it again until we leave. 

The arena was close enough that we were able to use a combination of public transit and walking, which made the whole experience just so nice. 

I have to say that the [Pechanga Arena](https://pechangaarenasd.com/) is a really nice place to watch a hockey game. 

Something that I've noticed is that [Acrisure](https://acrisurearena.com/) is really cold when compared to other arenas[ref]Toyota Arena in Ontario, Pechange Arena in San Diego[/ref]. I've been to two other arenas and in both of them I felt over dressed and was a bit warm. 

Anyway, the game was much closer than it needed to be, but [the Firebirds were victorious 6-5](https://theahl.com/stats/game-center/1027295) and ended a 7-game win streak for the Gulls. 

All in all a very nice way to spend an evening.
