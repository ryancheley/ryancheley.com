I'm super excited to see that [Hynek](https://mastodon.social/@hynek) is doing a series on his [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@the_hynek) about Python projects and uv in production. It's set to be a three part series, and the first episode [My 2025 uv-based Python Project Layout for Production Apps](https://youtu.be/mFyE9xgeKcA?si=P4ngBGL2S3q5eSvt) dropped a few days ago.

I finally had a chance to watch it, and wow ... I'm just so excited to see how it goes. Based on his workflow and workload it might be some time before he's completed, but honestly it's going to be worth the wait.

The approach he's taking is to use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), but only after manually going through the why's and how's of a Python project so you can have a better sense of what exactly uv is offering you, and when, or why you might want to change it to be different.

I'll likely watch it at least one more time and follow along to get a better sense of what he's working toward.

Can't wait for the next one!
