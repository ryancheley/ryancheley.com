I arrived in Portland for [PyCascades 2025](https://2025.pycascades.com/) earlier today. There was a pre conference social at [Hawthorne Asylum Food Cart Pod](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_Asylum) where we could pick up our badges and register and just get to meet some of the other attendees. There was exactly one person I knew for sure that I would know at the conference (Hi Velda!) and I was hoping that I'd run into her so I would have someone I knew. I'm terrible at social events where I don't know anyone.

I got to the venue a few minutes before the start time (because if you're not early you're late!) and I didn't really see anything that appeared to be related to the conference. I checked the site a few more times to make sure I was in the right place, and then resigned myself to just sit on a bench and play on my phone for a while.

And then, after about 10 minutes, I heard Velda call my name out. I saw her smiling with her contagious smile and knew that my night was going to be alright.

It was a good time, and I got to meet a few people.

It's funny ... sometimes you just need 1 person that you know at a social event to immediately make you feel a little more at home.
