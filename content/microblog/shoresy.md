Just a few days ago I finished up watching [Shoresy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoresy) for the second time. This is one of my all time favorite, gut busting shows. I love how honest, and earnest, the main character Shoresy is. The show is well acted, well written, and an all around good time.

Honestly, there are scenes that I've seen several times on YouTube clips, and in the show, that make me almost fall over laughing.

And I want to be clear. When I say watching Shoresy for the second time, I mean all three seasons of Shoresy for the second time.

Now, why would I do this?

Honestly, with all of the awful things going on right now, I need a respite. I need to be able to crawl into a place where hockey is a central character, where multilingualism is encouraged, and where there's a character that will just tell you how it is.

Shoresy isn't for everyone. Some will find it offensive for the same reasons I find it endearing. And I think that's OK.

But if you're finding yourself in a need to retreat from the world, for just a little while, Shoresy can give that to you. At least it did for me.

Can't wait for Season 4 to come out.
