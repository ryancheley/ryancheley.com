One of the great things about living in the desert of Southern california is that during the winter time the day time temps are typically in the high 60s or low 70s. This makes outdoor activities amazing experiences. What's even better is that every January / February the California Winter League gears up and my wife and will spend Saturday mornings (and sometimes afternoons) watching baseball under the gloriously beautiful sky.

The best part is that the teams are filled with high school, and college hopefuls, so it's baseball in kind of its rawest form. better than little league, but not quite as good as Pro ball. And since it's a winter league with essentially made up teams, my wife and I will pick a team to root for and then spend the ensuing 7 innings trash talking each other as 'our'  team is winning.

Another great part is that it's a relatively inexpensive outing. Each Saturday two games are played, and for $10 for each adult you get access to both games. The games are only 7 innings long but they use wooden bats instead of aluminum bats so it feels more like pro ball than college or high school ball.

And just because it's an instructional league doesn't mean there aren't some great plays made. Just today I saw a hit stealing diving catch made by a shortstop, and a diving catch into foul territory made by a right fielder that ran faster than I really thought was possible.
