The AHL All Star Challenge was tonight and it was some of the most fun I've had at Acrisure since it opened in late 2022. Most All Star style competitions are pretty unserious, and can be, in my opinion, kind of boring as well. I mean, I LOVE baseball, but watching the All Star game is not for me. And don't get me started on the Home Run Derby. Snooze fest for me.

The AHL All Star completion though was something else! A Skills day yesterday, but then the actual challenge today. Representatives from each division play in a 3-on-3 style, in 2 5-minute periods. If tied at the end, the tie is broken with a shootout. The top two teams with the most wins face each other in the Championship game.

The Championship game is a little different in that it's a 6 minute single period game. Again, if there is a tie at the end you have a shootout.

This means that you get to watch 7 'mini' games in about 2 1/2 hours. It's pretty intense.

The Firebirds were the host team this year, but we only had one All Star, [Cale Fleury](https://theahl.com/stats/player/7382/86/cale-fleury). He was called up to the Kraken, so a replacement, [Jani Nyman](https://theahl.com/stats/player/10127/86/jani-nyman) was made. Even though the Firebirds have a really good record (24-15-1-5), they only had 1 player on the All Star Game because the Pacific Division has 10 teams (read my thoughts on that [here](https://www.ryancheley.com/2024/02/24/realign-the-ahl/)).

Anyway, the competition was pretty amazing tonight, and I'm really glad I got to go. I'm kind of hoping to be able to go next year when it's in [Rockford](https://icehogs.com/news/rockford-icehogs-to-host-2026-ahl-all-star-classic).
