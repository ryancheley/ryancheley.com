I'm back home from PyCascades. I'm glad to be back home, but I sure did have a great time in Portland. Seeing old friends, and meeting new ones. I'm also really happy that my talk seemed to resonate with at least a few people. It's always nice to hear someone come up to you after a talk and hear them say that they liked it. I don't know that I did enough of that this weekend, because there were a lot of really great talks.

The flight back home was a bit of an adventure. My initial gate was at the very end of C terminal at PDX. It was then moved to B terminal so there was a little more walking than I was thinking there would be. Normally this wouldn't be such an issue, but my daughter Abby decided that she wanted to buy about 8 books and I was lucky enough to carry her bag.

Once we got to our new gate the plane was delayed about an hour. I still made it home at a decent enough hour, but it was a longer day than I was really expecting it to be.

Going to conferences can be hard, but they are a hard thing that is worth doing because of the new people you get to meet, and the old friends that you get to see. Ten out of ten, would recommend.
