A friend of mine sent me this image a while ago and it really does pretty much encapsulate my approach to clothes

The greatest part about this, in my opinion is that my socks are also always mismatched.

Is this on purpose? Yes!

More that 10 years ago now my daughter A (she's almost 19 now) took a pile of clean clothes that were  on her dresser and meant to be put away took them and put them into her hamper instead.

When my wife E and I saw this we decided that A needed to learn how much work and effort went into doing laundry. So next weekend she was responsible for getting it all done (with guidance from her parents of course).

This meant she had to sort the laundry, do the laundry, and put away the laundry.

It was with the putting away where the story gets really good.

After A completed the last load of laundry, which was mostly socks, she was sorting the socks into three piles:

1. Her Socks
2. E's socks
3. My socks

At this point E and I decided that A had it pretty well covered and so our supervision was done.

Now the thing about A is that she had this set of branded Miss Match socks that she LOVED. And she thought that socks were supposed to be thrown into a drawer willy-nilly and not meant to match.

So when A got to sorting mine and E's socks she applied her understanding of socks to our socks (which is 100% understandable!)

As she put away the socks she put her socks into her sock drawer, E's socks into E's sock drawer, and my socks into my sock drawer.

The next morning I was running late and by the time I got to getting my socks and shoes on I saw the sorting method of A. I was a little upset, but mostly just kind of laughed.

I grabbed 2 socks, put them on, and went to work. And you know what happened? Nothing. The world didn't end, I didn't lose my job, and all day I knew something that everyone else didn't. My socks didn't match.

To this day, I still just take my socks and throw them in my sock drawer. In the morning I will pick 2 socks at random and it still makes me smile.

Yes, my socks are wildly colorful ... but they also never match. And that's just fine by me.
