I'm heading to Portland this weekend to give a talk at [PyCascades](https://2025.pycascades.com/). I've given the talk before (last September in Durham, North Carolina at [Django Con US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eALdLBOaQS0)) and I'm still excited to give it.

Since I gave the talk I've been able to implement many of the things that I was promoting in my talk. Truth be told, I felt a bit like a fraud when I gave the talk at DCUS since I was still working on getting to where I wanted to be!

That being said, the talk has helped me, and hopefully, others, as they make their way through the journey of trying to get more meaningful information related to alerts and how to deal with them.

Even though I've already gaving the talk at another conference, I've been practicing every few days to make sure my timing is down, and that I feel prepared. This has been a much different experience than last time when I would record myself giving the talk, watch the talk and make notes, update the talk. Repeat that process 7 or 8 times and I got a talk that I was proud of.

It was exhausting but worth it!

Since I've already given the talk I'm mostly just making sure that my timing is down and I'm good with the slides. I've made a few adjustments, mostly related to my introduction and not much else.

I'm still nervous about giving the talk, but I'm pretty sure that's just the public speaking nerves!

Looking forward to being in Portland in just a few days!
