Last July I started swimming as a way to help relieve some stress related to some work stuff. I've spent the last 7ish months swimming 3 times a week and something weird happened on the way to getting into better shape.

I discovered that, for me, swimming is one of the most medatative experiences I can have. I used to run, [like a lot](https://www.ryancheley.com/2025/01/17/looking-back-at-the-half-marathon-streak/), but when I ran I spent most of my time listening to music, or podcasts, but never running silently. With just my thoughts.

I know that there are airpods, or airpod like things, that are water proof, but when I first started swimming I didn't want to invest in them as I wasn't sure if I would keep up with the swimming. So I just swam. Three days a week. All summer.

And it turned out that as I am swimming, either Breast Stroke, or Free Style, I'm just focusing on this stroke ... this breath ... this lap. For the first time in my life while being physically active, I was totally, 100% present with my situation.

This total presence allowed me to calm down, My thoughts would drift towards this, or that, but they always come back to her. Now. This stroke. This breath. This lap.

And as I've spent more time swimming I'm not really getting much faster, but I am getting into a better state of mental preparredness. A better state of mental health.

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not suddenly like the most Zen person you're ever going to meet[ref]I am a [hockey](https://www.ryancheley.com/tag/hockey.html) fan after all![/ref]. But, I am just a little more present. A little more here. A little more ... me.
