Since the All-Star break the Firebirds entered what is arguably their softest part of their schedule with games against San Diego, Henderson, San Diego again, Bakersfield, and Tucson. These 4 teams are in the bottom of the Pacific division and in San Diego's case they are 20+ points behind the Firebirds.

I'm not sure what the hell is going on, but in their first game in San Diego they won in Over time in what should have been a blow out, in their second game in Henderson they lost by 1 goal.

In their first home game post All Star break they again played San Diego and lost 5-3 (the last goal being an empty netter so ü§∑üèº) but they also gave up 2 goals in less than 40 seconds in the second period. That ended up really being the different.

That means 3 games into their 5 game 'soft' patch and they're 1-2. They play Bakersfield tomorrow night and I sure hope they find a way to get back into their winning ways because this has been some pretty shitty hockey to watch. [The Firebirds are 2-3 against the Condors this season](https://ahl-data.ryancheley.com/games?sql=select+*%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++games+g%0D%0Ainner+join+dim_date+d+on+g.game_date+%3D+d.date%0D%0A++where+d.season+%3D+%272024-25%27%0D%0A++and+%28%0D%0A++%28home_team%3D%27Coachella+Valley+Firebirds%27+and+away_team+%3D+%27Bakersfield+Condors%27%29%0D%0A++or+%0D%0A++away_team%3D%27Coachella+Valley+Firebirds%27+and+home_team+%3D+%27Bakersfield+Condors%27%0D%0A++%29%0D%0Aorder+by%0D%0A++g.game_id%0D%0A) and have yet to beat the Condors at home this season.
