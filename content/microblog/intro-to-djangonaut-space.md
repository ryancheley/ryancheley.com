During my first session with Team Venus today I went through some orientation (for lack of a better term) items with my awesome new Djangonauts. I'm writing it down here because I'm sure I've gone through this same write up before, but darned if I couldn't find it!

There are several ways to contribute to open source, and not all of them are code. Some items I like to call out are:

- Code
- Docs
- Pull Request Review

Many people might think that the only way to contribute is via code, but the other aspects are also super important!

Things I like the Djangonauts (and myself) to keep in mind during the program:

- Contributions aren't a 'race'. Go at your own pace.
- This is a volunteer thing. Life will come up. That's OK. If you have to miss a meeting just let me know.
- Expect to spend about 1 hour per week day (i.e. about 5 hours) per week working on your tickets.
- Fill our your workbooks at the end of each week Sunday; this will help me with getting help for you at these meetings
- Post your wins in Discord!
- Keep in mind the Showcase at the end of the program where you'll have an opportunity to show off what you've been able to do
- Other opportunities:
    - Pair programming with other Djangonauts
    - If you haven't started a blog, this might be a good time to. Writing up what you've learned can help to make that learning more concrete and can help others in the future (that might include your future self!)
    - Writing the Weekly `Updates to Django` section of the [Django News Newsletter](https://django-news.com/)
    - Connect and network with other Djangonauts

The most important thing, I think, is to have fun during this program. This is a unique experience and it should be one that you look back on fondly because you learned some stuff, met some awesome people, and most of all had fun.
