Work has been a bit hectic recently which has really cut into some of my open source(ish) community participation, at least the "in person" ones. I've not been able to attend a DSF Office hour, or had a chance to do my writing session, or go to Jeff's Office Hours for a few weeks.

Today was looking like I would miss Jeff's Office Hours again, but I realized that if I could go, even for 30 minutes, I should.

I didn't realize before hand how worth it the experience would be. I was only there for about 30 minutes, but it was such a great experience to see some people I hadn't seen in some while, and to talk a bit about hockey and Python and just generally listen to my friend banter about various things.

These types of community are so necessary and so rejuvenating for me. I need to remember this. Work will be hectic for the foreseeable future ... as with everything, there's too much to do, and not enough time to do it in.

I will most likely forget this again, until I remember it, but hopefully I can work hard to stay engaged in the ways that are helpful and needed for me.
