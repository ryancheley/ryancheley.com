I've had a bit of an earache for a while and last weekend I finally got around to going to Immediate Care to have a doctor look at it.

They prescribed some antibiotics and because I think the earache may have been caused by the amount of swimming / time in the pool I have been doing I decided to opt out of swimming last week.

This then also resulted in my opting out of going to the gym at all, and for reasons that I'm still not sure of, I also didn't even bother to go for a walk before work, at lunch, or after work.

Something else that has happened is that 3 of the last 6 nights I have woken up between 2am and 3am and not been able to go back to sleep no matter how hard I tried.

I realized this morning that these two things could be related. I have been swimming a little more than 1 mile 3 days a week for the last 3 or 4 months, and I've been going to the gym for at least 30 minutes 2 days a week.

These activities did a great job of tiring me out, but without them, my body is suddenly like, OK dude, we've got some extra energy to burn off. No need so sleep!

Thankfully my ear is better, and I'll be taking the last of my antibiotic tonight so next week I'll be back at swimming and the gym and hopefully also back to getting a full night's sleep ü§ûüèª
