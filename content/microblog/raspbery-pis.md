I have THREE raspberry pi's that I bought 7+ years ago now. And they still work as well today as they did then. They really are amazing little machines.

Over their lifetimes their uses have evolved, but I wanted to just write down some quick thoughts on what I do with them now. Let's call them, in no particular order:

1. ITFBD!
2. Exit Node
3. Extra one

## ITFDB[ref]It's time for Dodger Baseball[/ref]!

This raspberry pi sits above the TV in my living room. It reads the MLB API to tell when when a Dodgers game is about to start. It runs a message across a PiHat Sense 8x8 grid and gives the details of the game, i.e. start time, opponent, and record of each team playing. It does this starting 10 minutes before game time every minute until game time. It used to also have a recoding of the legendary Vin Scull saying, "It's Time for Dodger Baseball!" but an update did something to the ability for it to play sound and I've not had the time to resolve it

## Exit Node

I'm a big fan of Tailscale thanks to Jeff Triplett. They have a concept of an 'Exit Node' that allows you to look like you're coming from a different location that you actually are. Now, why would anyone want to do this? I have no eartly idea, but sometimes it's fun to pretend that I'm in an area other than Souther California. This typically happens between March and October. But yeah, there's not really a good reason to do this, and I have no idea why one would.

## Extra One

The last one mostly just sits around looking sad. It wants to be a thing, but I haven't quite figured out what it can be. At one point it lived as a motion capture camera above a humming bird feeder. It would take snap shots when it saw motion and then at the end of the day it would compile them into a movie and automatically upload them to YouTube. Why? No good reason other than I thought it would be fun to do. I've written a surprising number of posts on [this](https://search.ryancheley.com/pelican/article_search?text=hummingbird)

Raspberry Pi are fun. I highly recommend getting even one to just kind of play around with it.
