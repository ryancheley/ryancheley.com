Next week starts session 4 of [Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space/) and I've been selected to be the Navigator for Team Venus with an amazing group of people. As has happened before I go into this with an impossible amount of [imposter syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) lurking over me. While this will be my **third** time doing this it still feels all new to me and I'm constantly worried that I'm going to "do it wrong".

I have the start of a plan to help with my navigator duties, and I need to get that all written down so that I don't forget what needs to be done and when it needs to be done by! I'm hoping that I'll be able to pick up a ticket and work alongside my Djangonauts as I have done before, but the seasons of life can, and do, have a way of changing quickly.

Perhaps I can just try and focus on getting [my one current In Progress ticket](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/27106) wrapped up before diving into a new one ðŸ¤”

Anyway, I'm super excited about the prospect of Session 4 and can't wait to "meet" my Djangonauts on our first call next week.

Here's to hoping my imposter syndrome doesn't get the better of me ðŸš€
