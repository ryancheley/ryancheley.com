Today was one of my better swim times for the 2000 yards that I typically swim during the week. This was a bit surprising as it was the end of the week and I had, what I would consider, a pretty intense gym day yesterday. That being said, there was something about how I was able to seemingly, effortless, glide through the water.

I also didn't track my laps for which stroke I needed to do, which is a pretty good sing that I'm just listening to my body and switching up when I want to and not when I need to because it's time for a new stroke.

It was also a perfect morning for a swim. Slightly cool with no breeze and a beautiful sunrise hitting the left over storm clouds with a vibrant pink hue.

When it was all said and done I had a 2'37" 100yd lap time on average and more freestyle distance that breaststroke distance, which I hadn't done before.

Here's hoping to more improvement over the next few weeks in my swim time!
