After a week long hiatus from swimming I got back to it today. I only swam 1550 yards but it was a good swim. I kind of felt the need to take it a bit easy today given the week long break, and I needed to be at the office a bit early to get ready to help onboard a new employee. While it wasn't a great distance, or a great time (2'45" 100 yd pace) it still felt really good to be back in the pool.

I am again back to feeling 'pretty sleepy' early in the evening which I'm hoping will rid me of the [insomnia](2025/02/22/insomnia/) from last week.

One of the best / weirdest parts of the swim is the honking from the geese. About 25 minutes into my swim they seem to wake up and just start honking at each other ... or maybe at me ... or maybe at the people walking around. Not really sure.

It is slightly off putting. They are **very** loud, but it also makes me giggle ... so that's something.
