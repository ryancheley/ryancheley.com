Today on Mastodon [Eric Matthes](https://fosstodon.org/@ehmatthes) posted about his library [django-simple-deploy](https://github.com/django-simple-deploy/django-simple-deploy) and a plugin for it to be able to deploy to [Digitial Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and I am so pumped for this! 

I said as much and Eric asked why. 

My answer:

> all of my Django apps are deployed to Digital Ocean. I have a “good enough” workflow for deployment, but every time I need to make a new server for a new project I’m mostly looking through a ton of stuff to try and figure out what I did last time. This *mostly* works in that after a few hours I have what I need, but having something simpler would be very nice … especially if/when I want to help someone with their own deployment to DO

The number of times I have wanted to help automate and/or make deployment easier to Digital Ocean is numerous. It would have been extremely helpful for me when I moved off Heroku and onto Digital Ocean as I had **no idea** how to do the server setup, or deployment or anything remotely related. 

A few years later and I still don't feel 100% comfortable with it all of the time, and I'm a "web professional"

Eric's tool is going to make this so much easier and I'm so here for that!
