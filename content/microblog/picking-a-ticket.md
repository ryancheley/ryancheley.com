One of the hardest things about contributing to [Django](https://www.github.com/django/django) is picking a ticket. [Sarah Boyce](https://mastodon.social/@sarahboyce) has a [great short video](https://youtube.com/shorts/D6QHet5U82U?si=2q8CYBVnaTM3qD6G) on a method that she recommends and it's a great bit of advice. As part of the Djangonaut program I work to help my Djangonauts find a ticket to work on.

A few queries I recommend are
* [Sarah's Vulture](https://code.djangoproject.com/query?changetime=..Feb+12%2C+2024&has_patch=1&needs_better_patch=1&status=assigned&status=new&order=id&desc=1&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=component)
* [Needs Documentation](https://code.djangoproject.com/query?changetime=..Feb+12%2C+2024&has_patch=1&needs_better_patch=1&needs_docs=1&status=assigned&status=new&order=id&desc=1&col=id&col=summary&col=type&col=owner&col=component)

Using the Needs Documentation I was able to filter down to just [this](https://code.djangoproject.com/query?changetime=..Feb+12%2C+2024&has_patch=1&needs_better_patch=1&needs_docs=1&status=assigned&status=new&type=!New+feature&order=id&desc=1&col=id&col=summary&col=type&col=owner&col=component) and identify three tickets that seemed interesting:

* [Ticket 29177](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29177) with [this comment](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29177#comment:3) in particular
* [Ticket 27775](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/27775) with [this PR](https://github.com/django/django/pull/16207)
* [Ticket 18887](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/18887) with [this comment](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/18887#comment:15) in particular

Picking a ticket can be challenging, but using the filters can really help get you down to a smaller list of things to try and work on.
