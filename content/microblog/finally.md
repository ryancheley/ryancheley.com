Over the last 2 seasons the Coachella Valley Firebirds were 15-1 against the San Jose Barracuda. The one loss over those 2 seasons was a 5-3 loss at home that was a bit closer than then score showed. Coming into this season I really didn't have any reason to think anything other than we'd be on the same trajectory of beating the Cuda more often than not. 

I was wrong.

Coming into tonight's game the Firebirds were 0-4-0-2 against the Cuda with 2 of those loses by only 1 goal ... the hardest being the Teddy Bear Toss in San Jose where the Cuda won 1-0. It was brutal to watch.

Coming into tonight's game I didn't have super high expectations. I texted a friend of mine

> OK, in the previous 2 seasons the Firebirds are 15-1 against the Cuda. This year, they're 0-4-0-2. and 4 of those losses are 1 by 1 goal. What's even wilder is that 5 of Stezka's losses are against the Cuda. I think we'll be getting Grubauer today since Stezka is up with Seattle. I'm still a little unsettled about playing them, but maybe this time it will be different?

He was correct. [The Firebirds finally got a W against the Cuda](https://theahl.com/stats/game-center/1027270) ... although the 5-3 score was closer than I would have liked it to be ...  and there were plenty of chances for the Cuda to tie it up in the last 90 seconds. But finally, the first win. 

For the 2024-25 season we're now 1-4-0-2.

Hopefully we can keep up the winning ways!
