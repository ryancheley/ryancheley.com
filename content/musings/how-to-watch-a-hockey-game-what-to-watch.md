In [a previous post of this series](https://www.ryancheley.com/2025/01/27/how-to-watch-a-hockey-game-three-rules/) I laid out some basic rules of hockey. In this post I'll hopefully provide some tips on what to watch during your first few hockey games.

## What should I 'watch' though?

This is a tough question and depends on if you're watching on TV or in person.

### On TV

If you're watching on TV you're limited by whatever the camera and director are showing you. Hopefully they're pretty good at what they do and they'll help to show you what is interesting. You'll also have the benefit of replays. [ref]and refreshments that are much less expensive![/ref]

Watching the action on TV will be your best bet. The commentators will do a reasonable job of explaining the play. For some of the best NHL broadcasts you'll want to watch a Canadian feed. This might not be an option depending on where you live, but in general, watching a Canadian feed of a Canadian team will be really helpful.

If, for whatever reason, you're watching an AHL game[ref]home of my beloved Coachella Valley Firebirds[/ref] the best broadcasts to watch, in my opinion, are the Lehigh Valley Phantoms called by [Bob Rotruck](https://www.phantomshockey.com/staff/bob-rotruck/) and Cleveland Monsters called by [Tony Brown](https://www.tonybrownpxp.com/). Each of these is a single broadcaster doing both the color commentary and the play-by-play ... and they honestly get **so** excited it's hard to NOT get excited with them.

### In Person

For your first in person game, just try and follow the puck as best you can. If for whatever reason you can't do that, pick a spot on the ice to concentrate on, preferably near one of the goalies. Which one? The goalie of the team you're not rooting for is a good choice! Then you can just kind of watch the action there.

Keeping in mind [the rules](https://www.ryancheley.com/2025/01/27/how-to-watch-a-hockey-game-three-rules/) start by focusing on just one rule - either icing or offside - for an entire period. Once you feel comfortable recognizing that rule during gameplay, switch your attention to watching for the other rule in the next period. For example, if you spent the first period watching for icing, spend the next period looking for offside plays.

Hopefully after a full game you're able to see them when icing or offside happen. If not, it just means you'll need to come back and try again üòÅ.

## What not to worry about

Hockey is a fast paced game. No, like really fast. Don't worry too much about anything other than watching for the puck, if you can, and trying to pick up icing and offside. You'll see other stoppages in play when a penalty is called. The refs will make [hand gestures](https://www.chicagowolves.com/gameday/hockey-101/penalties-and-signals/) to indicate the call on the ice and someone will be sent to the box.

Don't worry about whether or not a fight will break out. They don't always, and if they do, each player will be assessed a major penalty and will spend 5+ minutes in the penalty box.

Don't worry too much about learning the positions. The goalie is an obvious one (that's the person with all of the pads, the bigger stick, and the giant, well painted mask in front of the net), but trying to distinguish between a defender and a center ... like just don't worry about it!

## Conclusion

Hockey is an amazing sport to watch, whether in person or on TV. It can take a little bit of time to get used to the fast pace, but hopefully this series has given you some tips to enjoy it and understand what's going on.
