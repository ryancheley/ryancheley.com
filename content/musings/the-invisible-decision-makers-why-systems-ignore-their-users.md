## The Origin of Systems

When thinking about systems it's easy to think that they have always been there, or been that way. This isn't true of course. The systems that are in place were put there, by people. People that made decisions. Decisions are what  I want to focus on here.

In general when making a decision about the implementation of a system you would want to engage with the stakeholders of that system. This of course implies that you can identify at least some of those stakeholders.

But sometimes there aren't any key stakeholders other than regulations, or best practice, or some other nebulous thing that needs to be met. These are the decisions I really want to focus on.

## The Illusion of Success

Take a security system for instance. The basic tenets of the security system are that it keeps 'something' safe. If the thing to be kept safe is still safe after the implementation of the security system then the people that implemented the system can claim success. They can look at the evidence that since the security system was put into place the thing has been kept safe.

Of course, it's entirely possible that the thing was never in danger, and that the previous system was doing just fine. In fact, it could be that the security system is actually making it harder to keep the thing safe. It's just harder to see because all you're looking at are potentially meaningless metrics like. Questions like is the thing safe after implementation of the security system don't take into account if the thing was 'unsafe' before? This can lead you to think that the new security system must be responsible for the safety of the thing.

Something else that can be happening is that the security system has caused the people responsible for keeping the thing safe to work more hours, hire more people,who are oftentimes  keeping the security system running.

## Questioning Purpose

The more we look into a system like this, the more we might ask, "Why is it there?"

There can be a couple of reasons, but I'll focus on one in particular. The person ultimately responsible for keeping the thing safe can show with some kind of metrics that the thing is safe with the new security system, whereas they couldn't under the previous system. There weren't any reports or metrics that showed what was going on, which is why the system was implemented in the first place.

OK ... so that's how some systems can be put in place.

## User-Hostile Systems

What about systems that are hard to use, or maybe actively hostile to their users? How do those get put into place? I would argue that the reason we see  many user hostile systems in place is because they are decided upon not by their users, but by their ability to meet regulations, AND their ability to maintain by a support system. The consideration of the user is secondary, or maybe not even thought about.

Think about any Enterprise software you've ever encountered. Would you say that it was a joy to use? Would you say that onboarding was simple, and that new employees loved to use it? My guess would be no.

## Why Bad Systems Persist

So if the users don't like it, why is it in place? Two reasons:

1. It meets some kind of regulation (this could be a government regulation, but it could also be a regulation of a guild, or union, or something else)
2. It's easy to maintain by the support system

For any software that meets these criteria you are likely to have users that don't like the software, because they are always an afterthought. The primary responsibility of the software developers of these types of systems is always the regulators, and the support infrastructure.

The first because they have to keep producing software that is compliant in order to be sold with a specific rating or seal of approval.

The second because if the support team can't easily support it, they're going to find an alternative solution that they can support.

## Conclusion

It's a simple decision of maximizing for the people that enforce the rules (regulators) and that make the decisions (support). The users of the software don't matter. At all.

This is why you will see software for widget processing that could benefit from bulk operations,  keyboard shortcuts, or being browser agnostic and they just aren't. The only considerations are: Does it meet the regulations? Is it easy to support? If the answers are yes then the users tend to lose out. They don't matter. If the answer is no, then find a competitor that does and move over to them, even if the current system is loved by your users.
