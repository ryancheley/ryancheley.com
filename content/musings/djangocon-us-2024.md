# DjangoCon US 2024

I was able to attend [DCUS 2024](https://2024.djangocon.us) this year in Durham from September 22 - September 27, and just like in 2023, it was an amazing experience.

I gave another [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLYaAYY4JPc) (hooray!) and got to hang out with some truly amazing people, many of whom I call my friends.

I was fortunate in that my talk was on Monday morning, so as soon as my talk was done, I could focus on the conference and less on being nervous about my talk!

One thing I took advantage of this year, that I didn't in previous years, was the 'Hallway Track'. I really enjoyed that time on Monday afternoon to decompress with some of the other speakers in the lobby.

One of the talks that I was able to watch since the conference was [Troubleshooting is a Lifestyle ðŸ˜Ž](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7iUKbug82k) which had this great note: Asking for help is not a sign of failure - it's a strategy.

I am bummed that I missed a few talks live ([Product 101 for Techies and Tech Teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75M0MC66H2o), [Passkeys: Your password-free future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylv_k8TRpPk), and [Django: the web framework that changed my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0Urp3RsKLY)) but I will go back and watch them in the next several days and I'm really looking forward to that.

There is a great [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2NFhrDSOxgWqE_5w5CX2iUR7-P1D0ny7) of ALL of the talks from this year (and previous years) that I highly recommend you search through and watch!

A few others have written about their experiences ([Mario Munoz](https://pythonbynight.com/blog/djangocon-2024) and [Will Vincent](https://wsvincent.com/djangoconus-recap/)) and you should totally read those. Some of the

## The Food

DCUS via the culinary experience!

Durham has some of the best food and I would go back again JUST for the food. Some of my highlights were

- [Cheeni](https://www.cheenidurham.com/)
- [Thaiangle of Durham](https://www.thaiangleofdurham.com/)
- [Queeny's](https://www.queenysdurham.com/)
- [Ponysaurus](https://www.ponysaurusbrewing.com/)
- [Cocoa Cinnamon](https://littlewaves.coffee/pages/old-north-durham?srsltid=AfmBOooaYRO5ZB5bS9mZ43O1J_lVMyXSD_4ma0i8GZjaRg7UxcOgPaAm)
- [Pizza Torro](https://pizzeriatoro.com/)
- The conference venue food - fried chicken and peach cobbler were my favorite

## The Sprints

During the sprints I was able to work on a few tickets for DjangoPackages[ref]settings consolidaion[/ref][ref]docs update[/ref] and get some clarification on a Django doc[ref]27106[/ref] ticket that's I've been wanting to work on for a while now.

## The after party in Palm Springs

I left Durham *very* early on Saturday morning to head back home to Southern California. Leaving a great conference like DjangoCon US can be hard as Kojo [has written about](https://kojoidrissa.com/conferences/community/pycon%20africa/noramgt/2019/08/11/post_conference_depression.html).

One upside for me was knowing that a few people from the conference were road tripping out to California and they were going to stop and visit! The following week I had a great dinner with Thibaud, Sage, and Storm at [Tac/Quila](https://tacquila.com/)

Here's [a toot on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@ryancheley/113237643354514479) with a picture of the 4 of us after dinner

## Looking Forward

I just feel so much more clam after the conference, and am super happy.

I'm looking forward to my involvement in the Django Community until the next DjangoCon I'm able to attend[ref]I'm working really hard on DCEU but the timing may not work out[/ref]. Some things specifically are:

* Working on Django tickets
* Admin work with Django Commons with Tim, Lacey, Daniel, and Storm
* Working on Django Packages with Jeff and Maksudul
* Djangonaut Space (if and when they need a navigator but just hanging out in the discord is pretty awesome too!)

I'm so grateful for the friends and community that Django has given to me. I'm really hoping to be able to pay it forward with my involvement over the next year until I have a chance to see all of these amazing people in person again
