There’s this new commercial by Apple called [Share Your Gifts](https://youtu.be/3dJCroCMBPM) all about a young creative woman that keeps all of her creativity to herself.

She does a really good job through the entire video of creating neat things, some seen, some not, and then making sure that no one else sees them by stuffing them into her idea box.

Her ideas are only shared when her dog opens the window to her apartment at which point her ideas are spread throughout the city.

People on the street see the ideas as the horrified young creator watches her creations get shared.

And you know what happens? People are genuinely happy about the creations that have been shared with them.

The creator’s fear that people would not appreciate or understand her creations were unfounded. People laugh and smile and enjoy what she’s shared.

It’s a hugely impactful video for me because I, like most creative people I’m guessing, are terrified of sharing what they’ve created.

What if what I made isn’t understood? What if no one likes what I've made? Worse, what if no one notices what I’ve made. What if people make fun of what I made. What if ... what if ... what if ... ?

I like this commercial because it takes those “what if’s” and turns it on it’s head! What if people connect with what I’ve made? What if people enjoy what I’ve made? What if people are happy because of what I’ve made?

The act of creating, for me at least, is less about any external validation, and more about trying out something new and learning, but I still am afraid to share.

These feelings, these “what if’s” can hold me back from sharing some truly fun things I’ve done. Who knows, maybe some of them are amazing.

So what if someone doesn’t like what you’ve made? So what if someone makes fun of what you’ve made? If you hold yourself hostage to the naysayers, and the potential negativity of the world, you rob the world of something truly extraordinary ... you.

And so, with this in mind, I am going to worry less about the potential negatives of what I create when I share it, and focus more on the happiness that it brings me, and the happiness it might bring to others.

Here’s to sharing your creativity ... here’s to sharing your gifts with the world!
