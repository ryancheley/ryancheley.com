Because I have a couple of posts that I need/want to work on, and I have the time to work on them, I have of course decided to instead to update the theme on my blog because that was a way better use of my time ðŸ˜‚

Also, because the day is just too nice to not be sitting outside watching baseball (even if it's on TV ... and even if it's the **ping** of the bat and not the **crack** of the bat[ref]Since the MLB Lockout is **still** going on and there's [no end in sight](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33347425 ), I've resorted to watching NCAA Baseball. I have to say, it's really entertaining AND it seems like there's 100 games on each day![/ref])
