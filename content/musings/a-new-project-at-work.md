I was added to a work email that was requesting a not-so-small new project that was going to need to be completed. The problem that needed to be solved was a bit squishy, but it had been well thought out, and it had an importance to it that was easy to see. 

There was still some workflows and data that needed to be reviewed, but overall it was on a good path to having a `real project` feel to it. 

One question still outstanding is, what platform will this project be implemented on? In our EHR, or on a separate web app? 

During my weekly project review meeting with the Web Development team I let them know about the potential for this new project and that it would likely need to take priority over one of our current projects. The start is still a couple of weeks away so we have time to plan for it (as much as we can anyway). We looked at the project board and determined a ranking of the current projects. We decided on the project that would likely get bumped if this new one ends up with the web developers. And just like that we had a contingency plan for how to plan for this project given our current constraints. 

Now, this project may never make its way to the web development team, but having that conversation with the manager, and then during our standup today, to let the team know that this **might** be something that will need to be worked on by them felt right. No surprises in a few weeks. No randomness about what projects we'll be working on ... just a bit of planning to prepare for something that might never come. 

Eisenhower said, "Plans are nothing, planning is everything."

The team appreciated being in the loop about a potential project and being able to align expectations moving forward. I felt grateful that this was brought to my attention well before it was submitted as a request. The requester now has a bit more information on who to speak with internally, and it really felt like we were working together to solve a problem in a very professional way. 

I wish all projects started like this. It would make life way easier and not so much like [this](https://oldbytes.space/@tschak/114661574560412783)
