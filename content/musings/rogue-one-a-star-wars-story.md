Rogue One - A Star Wars Movie: My Thoughts

Today I watched [Rogue One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_One) and I wanted to jot down my thoughts while they were still fresh.

First, what I didn't like:

1.  The Rogue One Font at the beginning on the movie. There was just something about it that wasn't as strong as the Original Franchise
2.  The jumping around done at the beginning of the movie with the planet names (again, with a weak font).
3.  There were no [Bonthans](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Bothan) either dying or otherwise.

OK, not that's out of the way. What did I like:

Every. Thing. Else.

Jin's character had the depth needed to be a protagonist you would both believe and want to follow. I think the most surprising thing (maybe ... I still need to think about this) is that from a writing perspective you know **ALL** of your characters are going to be throw away characters. They won't appear in Episodes 4-6, although the actions they take drive those movies.

As I realized this, I realized that each lead character was going to die. It can't really be any other way. And while I was sad to see that premonition come to fruition, I was also glad that the writers did what the story called for. Make the story a one-off whose characters can't influence the canon in any way other then how they already had.

Maybe I went into the movie with low expectations, or maybe it was just **that** good. Either way, I would see this again and again and again.

The story was strong, with dynamic characters. A mix of good and bad for the rebels (as it should be) and all bad, but with depth for the imperial characters.

I liked this so much I have already pre-purchased it on [iTunes](https://itun.es/us/mn6tgb).
