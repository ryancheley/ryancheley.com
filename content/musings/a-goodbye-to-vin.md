One of the earliest memories of my grandmother is visiting her in 29 Palms
[ref]Yes that 29 Palms, right next to the [LARGEST Marine Corp Base in the WORLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Air_Ground_Combat_Center_Twentynine_Palms)[/ref]
[ref]also the 29 Palms that is right next to [Joshua Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Tree,_California) home to the [National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Tree_National_Park) that is the current catnip of Hipsters[/ref] in her permanent mobile home. I remember sitting on the davenport watching the Dodgers on a small 13" COLOR CRT TV. I remember that the game was broadcast on KTLA5. But what I remember the most is the voice of Vin Scully.

I don't know what who the Dodgers were playing, but I remember how much my grandmother LOVED to listen to Vin call the game. And it stuck with me. I was probably about 7 or 8 and I thought baseball was "boring". To be fair, I thought most sports were boring, but especially baseball. Nothing ever happens! But, I loved my grandmother, and I loved hanging out with her [ref]she always had the [butter scotch hard candies](https://www.candynation.com/butterscotch-candy-buttons) that were my favorite[/ref] and so I watched the game with her.

Years later I discovered that yes, I did like baseball, and no, it was not boring. And since my grandmother was a Dodgers fan, then I would be too. It was something that connected us. it didn't matter where I lived, or how old I was, we both loved baseball. We both loved the Dodgers. We both loved to hear Vin call the game.

My grandmother died in 2007, but something that helped to connect me to her in the years since was watching the Dodgers. Listening to Vin.

As Vin got older, he still called the home games, but he handed most of the road games to a new crew. I still loved to Watch Dodgers games, but I loved watching the games he called a *little* bit more. At the start of each season I always kind of wondered, "is this the last year for Vin?". And in 2016 the answer was yes.

I still remember the last game [he called in Dodgers Stadium](https://www.espn.com/mlb/game/_/gameId/360925119). I remember the back and forth. I remember the Rockies going up 1 run in the top of the 9th. And the Dodgers tying it back up in the bottom of the 9th. And I remember when [Charlie Culberson hit the game winning home run in the bottom of the 10th](https://youtu.be/HayOXW09kl8).

I remember the last game [Vin called in San Francisco](https://www.ryancheley.com/2016/10/03/vins-last-game/). I remember the Dodgers lost ... but it was Vin's last game, so I still loved getting the chance to watch it. And to listen to him call the game.

Vin passed at the age of 94 on Aug 2, 2022. Just as I knew that there would be a day when Vin retired from calling games, I knew there would be a day when he wouldn't be with us anymore.

I've been trying process this and figure out *why* this is hitting me as hard as it is.

It all comes back to my grandmother. They never met each other (at least I don't think they did), but in my head they were inextricably connected. Vin was a connection to my grandmother that I didn't fully realize I had, and with his passing that connection isn't there anymore. He hasn't called a game in more than 5 years, but still, knowing that he NEVER will again is hitting a bit hard for me. And I think it's because it reminds me that my grandma isn't here to watch the games with me anymore, and that bums me out. She was a cool lady who always loved the Dodgers ... and Vin.
