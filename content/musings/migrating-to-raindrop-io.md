With the announced [demise of Pocket by Mozilla](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket) I needed to migrate all of my saved articles to 'something else' by the end of the month. I've actually tried to migrate from Pocket a few times over the years. I landed on [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) for a while, but it never really clicked for me. I tried a service called [Devmarks](https://devmarks.io/) that [Adam G Hill](https://indieweb.social/@adamghill) runs, and I really liked it, but for whatever reason I stopped using it. I had also previously tried [Raindrop.io](https://Raindrop.io/) ... and I'm not really sure what drove me away from it, but it didn't stick for me at the time. 

Since I didn't have a choice about Pocket I did a bit of purusing my options, and finally landed on Raindrop.io again. The process of migration is pretty painless. I just export out the links from Pocket and then import them into Raindrop. No fuss ... no muss. Raindrop even checks for duplicates and allows you to not import them! 

So, I imported everything (all 11,500+ articles!) and started to incorporate Raindrop into my workflow. This basically just means saving things to Raindrop instead of pocket, and then checking Raindrop instead of Pocket every week to make sure I'm all caught up on my articles to read. 

Over the last weekend I was looking at how all of the imported items in Raindrop were put into the 'archive' collection and decided that I could probably do something about putting them into proper collections. 

With the help of Claude Code, I was able to put them into better collections. There were some stragglers and I decided that I could categorize them on my own (there were less than 100).

I started going through these last ones I kept coming across articles for iOS7, or an app that I think I liked in 2015 but isn't on the App store anymore. I came across [this article](https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/what-the-internet-of-things-will-look-like-in-2025.html) (which I also [tooted](https://mastodon.social/@ryancheley/114689388596371458) about on Mastadon) from September 4, 2014 with the title `What the Internet of Things Will Look Like in 2025 (Infographic)`. It's wildly naive, but a fun read nonetheless.

Needless to say it was the only gem in the 100 articles that I went through. I had so many saved articles that aren't 'Evergreen'. I then started looking at some of the articles that had been categorized and came across stuff for Django 1.11, Python 3.8, and other older stuff. 

These were great articles when I read them, but I don't know that I **need** them now. In fact, when I looked at my general workflow for using any read-it-later service, I essentially save it to read later. If it's sitting in my read-it-later service for more than 4 weeks I'll either delete or just archive it. 

So really, unless I'm planning on *doing* something with these articles, I'm not sure that I need to keep them. And that's when it hit me ... I can just delete them. All of them. I don't need to keep them. If they are truly impactful, I can write up something about them in Obsidian. If I really think someone else will get something out of my reaction I can write it up and post it. But, if I'm being honest with myself, this is just digital clutter that isn't "sparking" any joy for me.

So, just like that, I went from having 11,000+ links to having 0. And I have [no ragrets](https://inkcredibletattoovb.com/bad-tattoos-no-ragerts/). 

I'm sure there's some deeper story here about physical things and just letting them go as well, and maybe I'll be able to apply that to my non-digital life, but for now, I'm just going to revel in the fact that I was able to offload this thing and just not ... care? Be sad? I'm not sure what the correct term would be here. 

Regardless, it was a good exercise to have gone through, and I'm glad I did.
