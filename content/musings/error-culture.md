It's inevitable that at some point a service^1 will fail. When that service fails you can either choose to be alerted, or not. Because technology is so important to so many aspects of work not getting an alert for a failing service isn't really an option. So we enable alerts for EVERYTHING.

This is good in that we know when things have gone south ... but it's bad in that we can start to ignore these alerts because we get false positives. If you hear comments like, "Oh yeah, that error always comes up, but we just ignore it because it doesn't mean anything" or "We don't really know why that error occurs, but it doesn't seem to impact anything, so we just ignore it".

This is what I am calling, "Error Culture".

If you have a culture that accepts errors and does not try to fix them, you are living in an Error Culture.

## What Causes Error Culture?



## I'm living in Error Culture ... Now what?

A different perspective on Error Culture isn't services that fail, but processes that fail with the same attitude to the problem. Oh, that error always occurs on the file inload, so we "just fix it" on the back end. Oh that error always happens when this package runs from the server instead of my machine, so I just run it from my machine instead.

[1] When I say service here I mean very loosely anything from a micro service up to a physical server.
