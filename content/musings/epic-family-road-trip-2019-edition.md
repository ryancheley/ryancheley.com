My daughter Abby was in the Robotics class at school this year. This gave her (and us as a family) the opportunity to go to the [Global Conference on Educational and Robotics](https://kipr.org/global-conference-on-educational-robotics) which was held in Norman, Oklahoma.

Being in Oklahoma we had a golden opportunity to road trip from Oklahoma back to home in California, so we did.

The trip went like this:

Fly from San Diego to Oklahoma City via Phoenix. Once we landed we were in the Oklahoma City / Norman area for a week as Abby competed in GCER.

While there, Emily and I were able explore quite a bit visiting Down Town Norman very nearly every day we were there. The neatest part of the Oklahoma segment was our drive down to Washington, OK where Emily’s grand father was born (or spent time as a child ... I’m not really sure).

Once we left Oklahoma we started the road trip in earnest. I’ve tried to create a Google Maps version of the trip, but the number of places we stopped is more than you can enter into a trip in Google maps.

Here are the vital statistics:

-   miles driven: 3730
-   cities visited: 17
-   national parks visited: 7
-   Baseball games seen: 3

And here are the details:

-   Norman, OK
-   Joplin, MO
-   St. Louis, MO
-   Hermann, MO
-   Jefferson City, MO
-   Kansas City, MO
-   Omaha, NE
-   Sioux Falls, SD
-   De Smet, SD
-   Pierre, SD
-   Black Hills, SD
-   Box Elder, SD
-   Rapid City, SD
-   Jewel Cave
-   Wind Cave
-   Hot Springs, SD
-   Cheyenne, WY
-   Greely, CO
-   Denver, CO
-   Grand Junction, CO
-   Arches National Park, UT
-   Cedar City, UT

We got to watch the OKC Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals, and Kansas City Royals all play and in each case the home team won. This was good because none of the MLB teams we saw were playing the LA Dodgers, and it’s always fun to see the home team win.

Finally, I also learned some things on the trip:

-   There's a ton of stuff to do in Norman
-   Missouri is *really* into World War I and its kind of weird
-   Omaha is the Silicon Valley of the midwest ... so much so that they call it the Silicon Prairie
-   Denver isn't actually in the mountains. It's just really high in the Great Plains on the way to the Rockies
-   Grand Junction In NOT a mountain town
-   Cedar City is more than just the little Main Street that I've seen before ... we stayed at a farm while we were there

The family is all glad to be home, and tomorrow it’s back to normal life. I have to say, I’m really looking forward to it.
