From a [Toot](https://mas.to/@natureworks/113917094844091858) by [Jake Rayson](https://mas.to/@natureworks)

In a previous post, I wrote about how to [ask why without sounding like a jerk](https://www.ryancheley.com/2024/08/22/how-to-ask-why-without-sounding-like-a-jerk/). This is a slightly related concept (at least in my head).

Sometimes, as technical people, we are asked to solve problems. The more we dig into them, the more we discover that the problem that needs to be solved isn't a technical one but a people one. In many cases, it's just getting two groups to actually talk to one another.

This can be hard and awkward, so people may want to avoid it. Creating a report telling someone they're doing something wrong is way easier. No hurt feelings! However, I've found that the approach tends to create more problems than it solves.

## The situation

The situation is a real one, and I'm obfuscating details to help 'protect the innocent'.

At the start of each year, large amounts of new data are needed to be added to a system. The additions are, by their nature, very manual[ref]yes I would like to automate this, but one step at a time![/ref] and so the team responsible for them spends much of their time trying to get the data added.

Another team is highly dependent on this new data being added in order to process their widgets[ref]Not actually widgets[/ref]. The widgets get loaded into the system and checked to see if the data from team A is complete. If it isn't, then the widget gets flagged. This flag directs the members of Team B to reach out to Team A to get clarification on the state of the data needed to process the widget.

Only, that's not how Team A understands it. While they are furiously trying to update data, there is some basic data that covers roughly 80% of the widget processing data needs that are already available. So, the vast majority of the time, there is no need for Team B to reach out to Team A because the information they need is available in the system to process the widget.

This understanding was either lost or never communicated effectively so Team B would just email Team A with questions about the widget data and then get their answer and move on. This is despite the fact that the information is available in the system for the members of Team B to review!

The leader of Team A asked me if I could 'update a report' to 'remove some of these widgets so Team A could better focus on the work of adding the data'.

I thought that seemed reasonable, so I asked Team B a few questions and then made a bit more discoveries and found out the actual problem, which was that the information needed by Team B was in the system. Team A just needed Team B to do a better job of looking for it and asking questions about the things that were needed instead of everything.

## The Solution

I proposed that the leaders from Team A and Team B get together to talk about the issue.

At the meeting, the leader of Team B was horrified to hear what was happening. They had no idea that many emails were going to Team A about questions that the members of Team B should be able to answer on their own.

This is all well and good, but why did it take a tech person to spot this and get the team leadership together to figure it out?

I wish I **knew** the answer. I think part of the insight I had was the current pipeline of work, how long it was going to create a report, and the need to have the problem solved sooner rather than later didn't line up. At all.

I **needed** to look for a potential non-technical solution. The other thing that I think happened here is that I wasn't weighed down by any history of interactions between the Teams. I was just trying to gather information. In gathering information I was able to see what the real problem was and that the only solution that made sense was for the two teams to just talk to each other.

## The Outcome

During the meeting, Team B committed to retraining staff and helping to make sure that they only reached out when there was an actual question about the data for the widget production. Team A was thrilled with this solution, and now they can focus on getting the data into the system more efficiently and with fewer interruptions. A win-win, all because a tech guy got some non-tech people to talk to one another.
