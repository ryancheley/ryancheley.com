I've been trying to update my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-cheley/) for a couple of weeks now (maybe a couple of months) and I keep hitting a roadblock. Not really sure why ...

Since being 'promoted' from Director of NextGen Support Services to Director of Business Informatics, I've wanted to update the Profile but haven't really had the 'time' to do it.

So a couple of weeks ago I decided that start in earnest on the update. I've done more research than I can stand but I don't feel like I'm any closer to an update that I like.

I think part of the problem is that I don't really know\* ~~what~~ who the summary is for. Is it for me or for other people. People that are reading my summary (for whatever reason people read LinkedIn summaries)?

If it's for me then I guess I'd write about the things that I really like to do, like data analysis and bits of programming to get to solutions to hard problems. If it's for other people then I guess I need to be genuine about who I am while also 'selling' myself to the prospective others.

Maybe the best thing is to write it for me and then hope for the best. I kind of like that. Besides, if someone else reads it and they don't like it then that's a good indication about how well I would get along with that person in a professional setting anyway and might be best to avoid them.

And if they do like it then all the better that they will also like me ... the real me.
