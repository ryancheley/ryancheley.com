New  Watch

## The first week

I've been rocking a series 2 Apple Watch for about 18 months. I timed my purchase just right to not get a series 3 when it went on sale (🤦🏻‍♂️). When the series 4 was released I decided that I wanted to get one, but was a bit too slow (and tired) to stay up and order one at launch.

This meant that I didn't get my new Apple Watch until last Saturday (nearly5 weeks later). I wanted to write down my thoughts on the  Watch and what it's meant for me. I won't go into specs and details, just what I've found that I liked and didn't like.

## The Good

Holy crap is it fast. I mean, like really fast. I've never had a watch that responded like this (before my series 2 I had a series 0).

It reacts when I want it to, so much so that I'm sometimes not prepared. It reminds me of the transition from Touch ID Gen 1 to Touch ID Gen 2. I really appreciate how fast everything comes up. When I start an activity, it’s there (no more waiting like on Series 2). When I want to pair with my AirPods … it’s there and ready to go.

I also really like how much thinner it is and the increase in size. At first I thought it was ‘monstrous’ but now I’m trying to figure out how I ever lived with 2 fewer millimeters.

I also decided to get the Cellular Version just in case. It was a bit more expensive, and I probably won’t end up using it past the free trial I got, but it’s nice to know that I can have it if I need it. I haven’t had a chance to use it (yet) but hopefully I’ll get a chance here soon.

## The Bad

So far, nothing has stuck me as being ‘bad’. It’s the first Apple Watch I’ve had that’s really exceeded my expectations in terms of performance and sheer joy that I get out of using it.

## Conclusion

Overall I **love** the Series 4  Watch. It doesn’t do anything different than the Series 2 that I had (except I can make phone calls without my phone if I need to) but *oh my* is it fast! If someone is on a Series 2 and is wondering if jumping to the Series 4 is worth it … it totally is.
