</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>One of my goals for 2017 has been to read more. According to <a href="https://www.getpocket.com">Pocket</a> I have been in the top 1% of 'pockters' in both 2015 and 2016, but even if that's true (and I'm not entirely convinced it isn't just marketing <strong>stuff</strong>) what I'm reading are web articles, some long form, but mostly short form articles.</p>
<p>This isn't the kind of reading I want to focus on in 2017. I've got a list of (mostly) science fiction books I'm planning on reading this year.</p>
<p>I'm also listening to audio books through <a href="https://www.audible.com">Audible</a> during my commute to work. Those books are a little more varied in their content so far, and exclusively non-fiction.</p>
<p>But why does this matter? As I <a href="https://www.ryancheley.com/blog/2017/1/26/struggle-determines-success">do</a> I was reading an article on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimovs">Isaac Asimov</a> entitled <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/isaac-asimov-how-to-never-run-out-of-ideas-again-b7bf8e09cc91#.tbua3lk49">Isaac Asimov: How to Never Run Out of Ideas Again – Personal Growth – Medium</a>.</p>
<p>From the article 4 points really struck me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read widely. Follow your curiosity. Never stop investing in yourself.</li>
<li>Diversity is insurance of the mind.</li>
<li>We fail. We struggle. And that is why we succeed.</li>
<li>After all, never having ideas means never having to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I had planned on reading more <strong>before</strong> having read the article, after reading it I'm even more dedicated to making sure I read as much as I can this year.</p>
<p>The last 2 points are also something I've been trying to work on. One of the reasons for this site is so I can showcase the ways in which I <em>fail</em> and what I am able to learn from those 'failures'.</p>
<p>The ideas that failure and struggle lead directly to success is something I'd never really connected, but I can see the connection between them now.</p>
<p>I like the idea that Isaac Asimov failed at things, but that they didn't prevent him from accomplishing those (and other) things.</p>
<p>This article really helped crystallize an idea that I've had a hard time putting into words ...</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Failing only happens when you don't try. Trying to do a thing and not achieving that thing is not failing, it's simply a different result than you expected. The success is in the trying.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know if these are the <em>best</em> words, but as I'm learning, the success is in the trying, not in the perfection of the result.</p>
