<p>Today I watched <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_One">Rogue One</a> and I wanted to jot down my thoughts while they were still fresh.</p>
<p>First, what I didn't like:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Rogue One Font at the beginning on the movie. There was just something about it that wasn't as strong as the Original Franchise</li>
<li>The jumping around done at the beginning of the movie with the planet names (again, with a weak font).</li>
<li>There were no <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Bothan">Bonthans</a> either dying or otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, not that's out of the way. What did I like:</p>
<p>Every. Thing. Else.</p>
<p>Jin's character had the depth needed to be a protagonist you would both believe and want to follow. I think the most surprising thing (maybe ... I still need to think about this) is that from a writing perspective you know <strong>ALL</strong> of your characters are going to be throw away characters. They won't appear in Episodes 4-6, although the actions they take drive those movies.</p>
<p>As I realized this, I realized that each lead character was going to die. It can't really be any other way. And while I was sad to see that premonition come to fruition, I was also glad that the writers did what the story called for. Make the story a one-off whose characters can't influence the canon in any way other then how they already had.</p>
<p>Maybe I went into the movie with low expectations, or maybe it was just <strong>that</strong> good. Either way, I would see this again and again and again.</p>
<p>The story was strong, with dynamic characters. A mix of good and bad for the rebels (as it should be) and all bad, but with depth for the imperial characters.</p>
<p>I liked this so much I have already pre-purchased it on <a href="https://itun.es/us/mn6tgb">iTunes</a>.</p>
