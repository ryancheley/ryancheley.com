</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This weekend I migrated my site from <a href="https://www.squarespace.com" title="Spare Squace!">Square Space</a> to <a href="https://www.wordpress.com" title="WordPress!">WordPress</a>. I had been planning to do this for a while (ever since a <a href="https://www.hover.com" title="Hover!">Hover</a> ad read on <a href="https://www.atp.fm" title="Accidental Tech Podcast">ATP</a> earlier this summer). This weekend was the last weekend before my <a href="https://www.squarespace.com" title="Spare Squace!">Square Space</a>subscription was set to expire so I finally made the switch.</p>
<h2>Why I did it</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.squarespace.com" title="Spare Squace!">Square Space</a> offers a beautiful interface and great templates to get you started. They make everything about setting up a blog, portfolio or online store as easy as it can get. But ... that’s kind of where it ends for me. While the set up is amazingly easy, the actually content posting (for me this means my writing) was more difficult than I would have liked.</p>
<p>In order to get something posted to my <a href="https://www.squarespace.com" title="Spare Squace!">Square Space</a> site I would write something in anyone of a number of Plain Text Editors (<a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>, <a href="https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a>, <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a>, <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a>). Then I would preview the generated <code>HTML</code> to verify it looked the way I wanted it to. Finally, I would post my <code>MarkDown</code> to the <a href="https://www.squarespace.com" title="Spare Squace!">Square Space</a> Blog App on iOS and do it All. Over. Again.</p>
<p>To say that it was frustrating is a bit of an understatement. I looked really hard to see what <code>API</code>s existed and found that there <em>used to be</em> an API but that Square Space removed them for some reason. So no direct posting to my blog by my favorite text editors.</p>
<p>So, with Hover having a discount on domains, and me getting an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</a>account where I could host WordPress and a rich set of WordPress <code>API</code>s to post directly from some of my favorite text editors, it seemed like a no brainer to make the switch.</p>
<h2>How I set up my Wordpress Install</h2>
<p>The AWS ecosystem has some amazing documentation on how to do just about anything that you want. So, instead of laboriously taking screenshots and writing up what I did, I’ll just link to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-wordpress-website/" title="Launch a WordPress Website">Amazon’s Launch a WordPress Website tutorial</a></p>
<h2>Exporting from Square Space to Wordpress</h2>
<p>For all the pain it was to get content into SquareSpace, it was a breeze to get it out. Again, no need to get screenshots or write it up if I can just <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206566687-Exporting-your-site" title="Getting my stuff from SquareSpace">link</a> to it instead!</p>
<h2>What I hope to gain from it</h2>
<p>As I wrote earlier my main reason for leaving Square Space was the difficulty I had getting content in. So, now that I’m on a WordPress site, what am I hoping to gain from it?</p>
<ol>
<li>Easier to post my writing</li>
<li>See Item 1</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing is already <em>really</em> hard for me. I struggle with it and making it difficult to get my stuff out into the world makes it that much harder. My hope is that not only will I write more, but that my writing will get <strong>better</strong> because I’m writing more.</p>
<h2>Ulysses integration</h2>
<p>With all of that, what has my experience been with writing my first post to my WordPress site?</p>
<p>This entire post was written and edited in Ulysses. I was able to preview my post in Ulysses. I was able to<a href="#">post my content to the site with Ulysses</a>. Basically, Ulysses is a kick ass app and on day one of the conversion, I’m about as happy with a decision that I can be given the short amount of time since I’ve made it.</p>
