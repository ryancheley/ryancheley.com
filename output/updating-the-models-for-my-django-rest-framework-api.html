</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I’ve been working on a Django project which would allow users to track games that they’ve seen and, therefore, see what stadia they have visited.</p>
<p>This is all being done at a site i set up called <a href="https://www.stadiatracker.com">StadiaTracker.com</a>. Initially when constructing my model I kept it relatively simple. I had one model that had two fields. The two fields tied the User from my CustomUser Model to a Game ID that I retrieve from an API that MLB provides.</p>
<p>I thought this simple approach would be the best approach. In addition to having a Django App I set up a Django Rest Framework (DRF) API. My initial plan was to have a DRF backend with a Vue (or React) front end. (I still want to do that, but I really wanted to try and finish a project before proceeding down that path).</p>
<p>After some development and testing I quickly realized that the page loads for the app were suffering because of the number of API calls to MLB that were being made.</p>
<p>I created a new model to tie the user id (still from the CustomUser model I’d created) to the game id, but in addition I’d get and store the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home Team Name</li>
<li>Home Team Score</li>
<li>Home Team Hits</li>
<li>Home Team Errors</li>
<li>Away Team Name</li>
<li>Away Team Score</li>
<li>Away Team Hits</li>
<li>Away Team Errors</li>
<li>Game Recap Headline</li>
<li>Game Recap Summary</li>
<li>Game Date / Time</li>
</ul>
<p>By storing all of this my views could render more quickly because they didn’t have to go to the MLB API to get the information.</p>
<p>Of course, once I did this I realized that the work I had done on the DRF API would also need to be updated.</p>
<p>Initially I kept putting off the refactoring that was going to have to be done. Finally, I just sat down and did it. And you know what, within 10 minutes I was done.</p>
<p>I only had to change 3 files:</p>
<ul>
<li>serializers.py</li>
<li>urls.py</li>
<li>views.py</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <code>searializers.py</code> and <code>views.py</code> all I had to do was add the new model and then copy and paste what I had done for the previous model.</p>
<p>For the <code>urls.py</code> it was just a simple matter of updating the the DRF path and detail path to use the new views I had just created.</p>
<p>It was so amazingly simple I could barely believe it. This thing I had put off for a couple of weeks because I was afraid it was going to be really hard, just wasn't.</p>
