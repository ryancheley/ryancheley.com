<p>On Sunday March 18, 2018 I ran the <a href="https://www.lamarathon.com">LA Marathon</a>. It was my first one and it was an amazing experience.</p>
<p>I never thought I would be able to compete in, let alone finish, a marathon, but on Sunday I did.</p>
<p>I started training, like <strong>really</strong> training, for the marathon last August. I would wake up every morning and walk for 45 minutes. This was to get me back into a shape that would allow me to run a bit.</p>
<p>On Sunday, September 24 I completed my first run since February 25th (basically 7 months between runs!). It was a 45 minute run that covered 3.82 miles. Over the next 6 months I slowly increased the distances I would run from that modest 3.82 run up to an 18 mile run. In total, I completed 89 training runs which covered 441.92 miles and spent 79+ hours running (see table below for details).</p>

<p>Month          Distance         Time         Runs
  September        14.68         3:03:14         4
   October         62.96         12:12:05        17
   November        87.70         16:52:06        20
   December        37.42         7:03:57         7
   January         90.80         17:09:12        18
   February        69.49         14:16:52        17
   March           43.06         08:29:11        6
   <strong>Total</strong>    <strong> 441.92</strong>   <strong> 79:06:37</strong>   <strong> 89</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>With all of the training that I did, there was a bit of December where I had pulled my right calf on a training run that forced me to rest for a couple of weeks. The only good news of that was that it coincided with a family trip to Utah where I would not have been able to really run while there (the average day time highs were in the teens and the ground seemed to be constantly covered in ice).</p>
<p>Also, with all of the training that I did, there isn’t really any way to train for race day itself. You get up early (in my case 3:50) and you take a shuttle to the start line and then wait. For hours. I got to Dodger stadium at about 5:00am but the race wasn’t set to start until 6:55am.</p>
<p>So I waited, with my running buddies, for the run to start. It was cold (about 48 degrees) and crowded. Once the race started it took nearly 20 minutes before I was able to cross the start line (there were nearly 25,000 people that ran).</p>
<p>None of the training that you do can really prepare you for this. Even if you do a race during your training, chances are it won’t have that many people, or have that many logistics involved with getting to and starting. That being said, having good company and a good playlist is essential.</p>
<p>I stayed with my coach, Marirose, for the entire race. We ran for the first 15 miles without stopping (except for a potty break at mile 5) and were making pretty good time. For the most part I felt really good.</p>
<p>But then something happened. At about 15 miles I hit a running wall. At 20 miles I hit a walking wall and didn’t want to finish. I think the only reason I finished was because I promised my daughter that I would finish a marathon and I wanted to keep my promise.</p>
<p>At mile 23 all I wanted to do was sit down and take a break, but I kept walking anyway.</p>
<p>Finally, at mile 26 I could see the finish line and Marirose and I ran the last 0.2 miles to the finish line. I had such a wave of emotion.</p>
<p>I kind of wanted to cry. I wanted to cry because I had accomplished an amazing physical feat. I wanted to cry because I hurt EVERYWHERE. I wanted to cry because it was my daughter’s 12 birthday and I was running a marathon and she was home with family friends.</p>
<p>With the wave of emotion and the feeling of having completed such an awesome experience I walked towards the people handing out the medals and got my finisher’s medal.</p>

<p>Now, not only did I have the feeling of completing the LA Marathon, I had a physical manifestation of that feat!</p>
<p>When it was all said and done my unofficial time for the <a href="https://www.trackshackresults.com/lamarathon/results/2018/mar_results.php?Link=14&amp;Type=2&amp;Div=F&amp;Ind=4">LA Marathon was 05:56:08</a>. Not too shabby for a first timer. Not too shabby for guy who 7 months earlier struggled to run 45 minutes and wasn’t sure he’d ever be able to get past 10 miles.</p>
<p>After the race on Sunday I said I’d never do a marathon again. I had checked it off my bucket list and that was that.</p>
<p>Now, sitting here, only a couple of days later, I’m thinking that <strong>never</strong> is a long time and that there is a possibility that yes, I might run another marathon.</p>
<p>But not for a while. For now, I’ll stick to my next goal of getting to a sub 25-minute 5k and running a half marathon every year. Those goals seem a little more reasonable, and a little less brutal on my body!</p>
