&lt;h2&gt;The first week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been rocking a series 2 Apple Watch for about 18 months. I timed my purchase just right to not get a series 3 when it went on sale (🤦🏻‍♂️).

&lt;h2&gt;The first week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been rocking a series 2 Apple Watch for about 18 months. I timed my purchase just right to not get a series 3 when it went on sale (🤦🏻‍♂️). When the series 4 was released I decided that I wanted to get one, but was a bit too slow (and tired) to stay up and order one at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant that I didn't get my new Apple Watch until last Saturday (nearly5 weeks later). I wanted to write down my thoughts on the  Watch and what it's meant for me. I won't go into specs and details, just what I've found that I liked and didn't like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy crap is it fast. I mean, like really fast. I've never had a watch that responded like this (before my series 2 I had a series 0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reacts when I want it to, so much so that I'm sometimes not prepared. It reminds me of the transition from Touch ID Gen 1 to Touch ID Gen 2. I really appreciate how fast everything comes up. When I start an activity, it’s there (no more waiting like on Series 2). When I want to pair with my AirPods … it’s there and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really like how much thinner it is and the increase in size. At first I thought it was ‘monstrous’ but now I’m trying to figure out how I ever lived with 2 fewer millimeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also decided to get the Cellular Version just in case. It was a bit more expensive, and I probably won’t end up using it past the free trial I got, but it’s nice to know that I can have it if I need it. I haven’t had a chance to use it (yet) but hopefully I’ll get a chance here soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, nothing has stuck me as being ‘bad’. It’s the first Apple Watch I’ve had that’s really exceeded my expectations in terms of performance and sheer joy that I get out of using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; the Series 4  Watch. It doesn’t do anything different than the Series 2 that I had (except I can make phone calls without my phone if I need to) but &lt;em&gt;oh my&lt;/em&gt; is it fast! If someone is on a Series 2 and is wondering if jumping to the Series 4 is worth it … it totally is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Apple"></category><category term="Apple"></category><category term="Watch"></category></entry></feed>
