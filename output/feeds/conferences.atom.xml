&lt;p&gt;The …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://tc19.tableau.com"&gt;Tableau Conference&lt;/a&gt; was held at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center this year (and will be again next year in 2020). I had the opportunity to attend (several weeks ago) and decided to write up my thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an introverted newbie’s guide navigating the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference started on Tuesday with pre-conference sessions that you had to register (and pay for). I did not attend those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday night there was a big welcome reception that I very nearly bailed on because of how many people there were, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. I’m glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The welcome reception (as well as all of the meals) were held in the data village (basically the convention show floor) which was a little weird but it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the reception they had industry specific areas (healthcare being one of them). I didn’t know this going in ... I just kind of stumbled into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the luckiest break I could have had as I sat there there entire night and met about 10 people. Three of them (Josh, Kerry, and Molly) I spoke to the most, so much so that we decided that we’d go to the ' Data Night Out’ (the client party) together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being super introverted this was not my jam, but I’m glad I went, and I will go again next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day is jam packed full of sessions. I didn’t come across any sessions that were not worthwhile, although some were better than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do have to register for the session in order to gain admittance to the room (they scan your badge to make sure you belong) but there seemed to be stand by room in most of the sessions I attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keynote events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ‘Key Note’ events to kick off each day. They happen in the Mandalay Bay events center, but there is also an overflow room you can watch them from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend going to at least one event in the events center, but as an introvert the overflow was really more my speed. A room that could sit 500 people with only 50 in it ... yes please!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iron Viz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A take on Iron Chef, Iron Viz was a chance for 3 Tableau wizards to showcase their skills with Tableau and a shared data set. It was really interesting to see the different ways that the data could be presented and the different stories that each competitor told for their visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Night Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t do this, mostly because by Thursday I was pretty overwhelmed and just needed a quite night in. I don’t regret not going, but I think I will make myself go next year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to write more on this once I get my head really wrapped around it, but suffice it to say, this is something that I think is going to be very important going forward for the organization I work for.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Conferences"></category><category term="Beginner"></category><category term="Tableau"></category></entry><entry><title>HIMSS Day 3</title><link href="https://www.ryancheley.com/himss-day-3.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-08T20:08:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-03-08T20:08:00+01:00</updated><author><name>ryan</name></author><id>tag:www.ryancheley.com,2018-03-08:/himss-day-3.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the issues that any medium- to large-organization can encounter is how to deal with requests that place a requirement of work from one department to another.

Specifically, requests for something shiny and new (especially technology).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first educational session of the day, &lt;strong&gt;Strategic Portfolio Management: “Governing the Ungoverned”&lt;/strong&gt; I heard &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/effie-economopoulos-94a23a6/" title="Effie Economopoulos"&gt;Effie Econompolous&lt;/a&gt; discuss UI Health’s transformation from an organization that had very little control over their IT projects to one that has transformed into a highly regulated Project Management Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My key takeaways from this talk were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;segregation of Projects (with a capital P) from Incidents and Problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The IT Roadmap was posted on the intranet for all to see&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects that are ‘IT’ related don’t just include the time of resources from IT, but also time and resources from impacted departments throughout the organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some amazing points. My only real question was, If you segregate Projects from Incidents and Problems, how do you ‘train’ users for Project submission. How are they do know the difference between the two (sometimes users aren’t even sure which system is broken when reporting problems in the first place). I’m not sure of the answer, but I’m sure it’s just thought more education and tighter controls over submission of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a real time poll during the session which asked, ‘What is the most significant challenge in your organization?’. Fifty percent of attendees that responded indicated inconsistent priorities as the (which is what I answered as well). Turns out, we’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the talk focused on the process that UI Health uses which had gone through 3 iterations in 2 years. It seemed like it would work for a large(ish) hospital or hospital system, but seemed too beauracratic for my organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a very good talk and I’m glad I went. I believe I have some real actionable ideas that I can take away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second educational session of the day &lt;strong&gt;Improving Patient Health Through Real-Time ADT Integration&lt;/strong&gt; I heard about a Managed Medical Group from Minnesota and their journey to get ADT feeds into the Care Management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to hear something a little more helpful, but while their situation was similar to the one we have at my organization, it was different enough that all I really heard was that, although my organization doesn’t have ADT feeds (yet) we seem to be a bit ahead of them in many other areas of managed care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tips that they offered up (getting user buy-in, working through issues with all of the various vendors) were things I had already known would need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I did hear, that I hope I don’t have to go through, is a ‘Live’ testing process where we get all of the vendors, hospital IT and group IT on the phone to test the system in a ‘Live’ environment to identify deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hope that any user manual we have to create isn’t 70 pages like the one they have (eeek!!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it will also be important to have metrics regarding efficiencies before and after any ADT implementations to make sure that we have actually done something helpful for the organization and the member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third talk &lt;strong&gt;Closed Loop Referral Communications&lt;/strong&gt; was a bit of a disappointment. A group from North Carolina reviewed how they closed the loop on referral management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping for some key insights, but it ended up being mostly about stuff that we had already done (identifying workflow issues, automating where possible) but they still have a fundamental issue with external provider referrals (just like us). I guess I was just hoping that someone would have solved that problem, but if they have, they aren’t sharing the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My forth session &lt;strong&gt;Breaking Down Barriers with Master Data Management and Data Governance&lt;/strong&gt; was really interesting and in the same vein as the first talk of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several good points mentioned during the talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited access to data leads to duplication of efforts and numerous sources of the ‘truth’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have Tech and People then you get ‘automated chaos’ ... this is why we NEED process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficult to turn data into actionable information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant barriers to accessing information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use reference data regarding report creation ... instead of asking the report requester questions, you need domain experts to define various categories (Diabetes, sepsis).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best Version of the Truth and Golden Record ... need to review this and see how it applies to DOHC/AZPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most astounding thing I heard was that each report costs between \$1k and \$5k to create ... 40% are used 5 times or less! What a source of potential waste that could perhaps be ‘solved’ by self service. We need to have metrics that show not many reports have we created, but instead how many are bing used!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons learned by speaker :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance: keep information at forefront for all front line areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance: not a one time effort, it’s on-going&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KPI Standardization: requires resilience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KPI Standardization: processes that work around the system need to be identified and brought into the fold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth talk of the day &lt;strong&gt;From Implementation to Optimization: Moving Beyond Operations&lt;/strong&gt;. Much of what was presented resonated with me and was stuff that we have dealt with. It was nice to know that we’re not alone! The most interesting part of the talk were the 2 polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one asked, “Do you use an objective tool for prioritization of incoming work?” Most responses were for No, but would be interested (47%); next response was yes but we bypass (32%). Only about 20% have one, use it and it’s effective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second poll asked, “Do you collaborate with Clinical Stakeholders?” Most responses were yes and split 2-1 between Yes and there’s tension to Yes and we’re equal partners (which is where I think we’re at).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Last talk of the day, &lt;strong&gt;How Analytics Can Create a Culture of Continuous Improvement&lt;/strong&gt;. It was an interesting talk that focused on using Analytics to drive continuous improvement. Some of the things that really caught my attention were the ideas of implementing continuous improvement is part of the job description. Part of that was something that is stated in the New Employee Orientation, “Do the job you were hired for and make it better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another intersting point was that there is no one Big Bang solution for Emergency Department throughput (though the idea can be applied to any problem you’re facing). You need to look at improving each step a little bit along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in order to do this effectively, you need data, team and a process. This reminded me of the &lt;strong&gt;Breaking Down Barriers with Master Data Management and Data Governance&lt;/strong&gt; talk I was at earlier in the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great final day at HIMSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a ton at this conference and writing about it (like this) has really helped to solidify some thoughts, and make me start asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll need to remember to do this at my next conference.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Conferences"></category><category term="HIMSS18"></category></entry><entry><title>HIMSS Day 2</title><link href="https://www.ryancheley.com/himss-day-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-08T06:23:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-03-08T06:23:00+01:00</updated><author><name>ryan</name></author><id>tag:www.ryancheley.com,2018-03-08:/himss-day-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Day 2 was a bit more draining than day 1, but that was mostly because I made my way into the exhibition hall for the first time.

That many people and that much cacophony always leave me a bit ... drained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side I went to several good presentations (a couple on Block Chain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s sessions were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empowering Data Driven Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blockchain 4 Healthcare: Fit for Purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Use of Blockchain to Improve Quality Outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting things I heard today was that in Health Care, tech spending has gone up (over the last 20 years) but so has overall health spending. Usually we see Tech spending go up and other spending levels off (or goes down!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else to consider (that I never had) was that “we need to think about doing what’s most cost effective for a person in their &lt;strong&gt;lifetime&lt;/strong&gt; not just episodically!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blockchain sessions I went to were enlightening, but I’m still not sure I understand what it is and how it works (perhaps I’m just trying to make it more complicated than it is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the consensus was that Blockchain is not a panacea for all the ails us. It is a tool that should be used in conjunction with current systems, not a replacement of those systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else of note, there isn’t a single implementation of Block Chain, there are almost 20 variations of it (although the IEEE is working on standardizing it). This leads me to believe that it is simply too new and too ‘wild’ to be implemented just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think that if/when Microsoft bundles or includes BlockChain (in some way) into SQL Server, then it might be the time to look at implementing it in my organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last session (another on eon BlockChain) the idea of using BlockChain to effect quality measures was discussed. The main point of the speaker was that Blockchain may allow us to give agency to patients over their health data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting point was that Blockchain may be able to allow us to dynamically observe quality measurement instead of just at point of care. This could lead to higher quality and lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the BlockChain talks were good, and kind of helped point me in the right direction on what questions to start asking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, day 2 is in the books. One more day of educational sessions and exhibits!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Conferences"></category><category term="HIMSS18"></category></entry><entry><title>HIMSS Day 1 Impressions</title><link href="https://www.ryancheley.com/himss-day-1-impressions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-07T06:51:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-03-07T06:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name>ryan</name></author><id>tag:www.ryancheley.com,2018-03-07:/himss-day-1-impressions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was able to make it to 5 educational sessions today.

And the good thing is that I learned something at each one. I think the highlight of the day for me was actually my first session titled, &lt;em&gt;Stacking Predictive Models to Reduce Readmissions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of key things from that presentation was the idea of focusing on a patient that readmits, not just from a clinical perspective, but from a human perspective. There were lots of technology that they used to help the care coordinators identify who was going to readmit, but the why of the readmission was always done via human interaction. I think that may be the single most important thing to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else that was mentioned was that the grou got their tool out quickly instead of trying to be perfect. It went through a couple of iterations in order to get a tool that was usable by all their various clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other key takeaways from today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to focus on Augmented Human Intelligence instead of Artificial Intelligence (from &lt;strong&gt;How Machine Learning and AI Are Disrupting the Current Healthcare System&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t treat Cloud Service Providers as &lt;strong&gt;Plug and Play&lt;/strong&gt; vendors (from &lt;em&gt;HIPAA and a Cloud Computing Shared Security Model&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of a committee of ‘No’ to help flesh out ideas before they are implemented (from &lt;strong&gt;Intrapreneurship and the Approach to Innovation From Within&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about how to operationalize insights from data, and not just explore the data (from &lt;strong&gt;Beyond BI: Building Rapid-Response Advanced Analytics Unit&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a wrap on day 1 at HIMSS. Day 2 looks to be just as exciting (meet with some vendors, attend some more educational sessions, go to a sponsored luncheon).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Conferences"></category><category term="HIMSS18"></category><category term="HIT"></category></entry><entry><title>HIMSS Recap</title><link href="https://www.ryancheley.com/himss-recap.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-25T19:10:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-02-25T19:10:00+01:00</updated><author><name>ryan</name></author><id>tag:www.ryancheley.com,2017-02-25:/himss-recap.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've gone through all of my notes, reviewed all of the presentations and am feeling really good about my experience at HIMSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to get ADT enabled for the local hospitals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to have a governance system set up for a variety of things, including data, reporting, and IT based projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the educational sessions (in no particular order) I attended and my impressions. Mostly a collection of &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; facts (I've left the Calls to Action for my to do list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing the Right IT Projects to Deliver Strategic Value&lt;/strong&gt; presented by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-selva-49207351"&gt;Tom Selva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethjeremykatz"&gt;Seth Katz&lt;/a&gt; they really hit home the idea that there is a relationship between culture and governance. The culture of the organization has to be ready to accept the accountability that will come with governance. They also indicated that process is the most important part of governance. Without process you &lt;strong&gt;CANNOT&lt;/strong&gt; have governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to great advice, they had great implementation strategies including the idea of requiring all IT projects to have an elevator pitch and a more formal 10 minute presentation on why the project should be done and in what way it aligned with the strategy of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semantic data analysis for interoperability&lt;/strong&gt; presented by &lt;a href="http://iems.ucf.edu/mshse"&gt;Richard E. Biehl, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; showed me that there was an aspect of data that I hadn't ever had to think about. What to do when multiple systems are brought together and define the same word or concept in different ways. Specifically,, "Semantic challenge is the idea of a shared meaning or the data that is shared". The example on relating the concept of a migraine from ICD to SNOMED and how they can result in mutually exclusive definitions of the same 'idea' was something I hadn't ever really considered before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Generation IT Governance: Fully-Integrated and Operationally-Led&lt;/strong&gt; presented by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-bosch-md-46b921"&gt;Ryan Bosch, MD, MBAEHS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fran-turisco-015096a"&gt;Fran Turisco, MBA&lt;/a&gt; hit home the idea of &lt;strong&gt;Begin with the End in mind&lt;/strong&gt;. If you know where you're going it's much easier to know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to get there. This is something I've always instinctively felt, however, distilling it to this short, easy to remember statement was really powerful for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.himssconference.org/sites/himssconference/files/pdf/206.pdf"&gt;Link to HIMSS Presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing a “Need-Based” Population Management System&lt;/strong&gt; presented by&lt;br&gt;
Rick Lang and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-hediger-a1765"&gt;Tim Hediger&lt;/a&gt; hammered home the idea that "Collaboration and Partnering are KEY to success". Again, something that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; but it's always nice to hear it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Intelligence for Reducing Clinical Variation&lt;/strong&gt; presented by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowland-todd-stewart-md-7a85b6b"&gt;Todd Stewart, MD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/francis-campion-b3a8047"&gt;F.X. Campion, MD, FACP&lt;/a&gt; was one of the more technical sessions I attended. They spoke about how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning don't replace normal analysis, but instead allow us to focus on what hypothesis we should test in the first place. They also introduced the idea (to me anyway) that data has &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt; and that &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt; can be analyzed to lead to insight. They also spoke about 'Topological Data Analysis' which is something I want to learn more about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving Patient Engagement through mobile care management&lt;/strong&gt; presented by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-beaton-7848071b"&gt;Susan Beaton&lt;/a&gt; spoke about using &lt;em&gt;Health Coaches&lt;/em&gt; to help patients learn to implement parts of the care plan. They also spoke about how "Mobile engagement can lead to increased feeling of control for members" These are aspects that I'd like to see my organization look to implement in the coming months / years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Real time notifications for care transitions&lt;/strong&gt; presented by&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-fontaine-3b68144"&gt;Elaine Fontaine&lt;/a&gt; spoke about using demographic data to determine the best discharge plan for the patient. In one of the presentations I saw (Connecticut Hospitals Drive Policy with Geospatial Analysis presented by Pat Charmel) the presenter had indicated that as much as 60% of healthcare costs are determined by demographics. If we can keep this in mind we can help control healthcare costs much more effectively, but it lead me to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much do we know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much can we know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what aspects of privacy do we need to think about before embarking on such a path?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Turn: Data Quality and Integrity&lt;/strong&gt; which was more of an interactive session when asked the question "What would a National Patient Identifier be useful for?" most attendees in audience felt that it would help with information sharing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Analytics: A Foundation for Care Management&lt;/strong&gt; presented by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-taylor-56039864"&gt;Jessica Taylor, RN&lt;/a&gt; and Amber Sloat, RN I saw that while California has been thinking about and preparing for value based care for some time, the rest of the country is just coming around to the idea. The hospital that these Nurses work for are doing some very innovative things, but they're things that we've been doing for years. The one thing they did seem to have that we don't is an active HIE that helps to keep track of patients in near real time. I would love to have! One of the benefits of a smaller state perhaps (they were from Maine)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A model of data maturity to support predictive analytics&lt;/strong&gt; presented by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-o-malley-49995b8"&gt;Daniel O’Malley, MS&lt;/a&gt; was full of lots of charts and diagrams on what the University of Virginia was doing, but it was short on how they got there. I would have liked to have seen more information on roadblocks that they encountered during each of the stages of the maturity. That being said, because the presentation has the charts and diagrams, I feel like I'll be able to get something out of the talk that will help back at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emerging Impacts on Artificial Intelligence on Healthcare IT&lt;/strong&gt; presented by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jigolden"&gt;James Golden, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; and Christopher Ross, MBA. They had a statistic that 30% of all data in the world is healthcare data! That was simply amazing to me. They also had data showing that medical knowledge doubles every THREE years. This means that between the time you started medical school and the time you were a full fledged doctor the amount of medical knowledge could have increased 4 to 8 fold! How can anyone keep up with that kind of knowledge growth? The simple answer is that they can't and that's why AI and ML are so important for medicine. But equally important is how the AI/ML are trained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1 started with …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had meant to do a write up of each day of my HIMSS experience, but time got away from me, as did the time zone change, and here I am at the end of HIMSS experience with only my day 0 notes down on &lt;em&gt;paper&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1 started with a rousing Keynote by Ginni Rometty, the CEO of IBM. The things that struck me most about her keynote were here sense of optimism about the future sprinkled with some caution about AI, Machine Learning and Big Data. She reminded us that the computers that we are using for our analyst is are tools to help, not replace, people and that it is incumbent upon us, the leaders of HIT, to keep in the front of our minds how these BIG Data AI/ML algorithms were trained. As the old saying goes, "Garbage In, Garbage Out"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also was able to record a bit of &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ou0kgdfnwyrxdsa/Ginni%20Rometty.m4a?dl=1"&gt;her keynote speech&lt;/a&gt; just in case I need to find and listen to it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tweeted a couple of times during the keynote (and even got some likes and retweets ... not something I'm used to getting)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Transparency in the Era of Cognition with the help of @ibmwatson #himss17&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Artificial intelligence is out of its winter ... I sure hope so, but time will tell #himss17&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Integration in workflow is the key to adoption #himss17&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Don't let others define you. Great words from @GinniRometty #himss17&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Growth and comfort never coexist. Another great gem from @GinniRometty #himss17&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent almost all of my time on day 1 in educational sessions. One things that I noticed from my first class was just how &lt;em&gt;FULL&lt;/em&gt; it was 15 minutes before the session even started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The Emerging Impacts of AI on HIT was full 15 minutes before the session started! Something tells me lots of ppl interested in AI #HIMSS17&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the session title were a bit misleading, but eventually most of them would come around. A class with a title of &lt;em&gt;Connecticut Hospitals Drive Policy with Geospatial Analysis&lt;/em&gt; was more about the Connecticut Hospitals and less about the Geospatial Analysis, but in the end I was what I was hoping to see which was people using Geospatial Analysis to help identify, and perhaps risk stratify patients to give the best care possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tweet when the class was over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Great talk on #geospatial analysis. So many ideas floating through my head now on potential actions and analysis #HIMSS17&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended my HIMSS 2017 experience on a high note with a great session titled &lt;em&gt;Choosing the Right IT Projects To Deliver Strategic Value&lt;/em&gt;. I'm still processing everything that came out of that session, but it left me feeling very positive about the future. It was nice to have the same, or at least very similar, feeling of optimism at the end of HIMSS as I had at the beginning after Mrs. Rometty's Keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be writing up my notes and linking to the presentations later this week (maybe whilst I'm flying back home to California tomorrow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a conference I am overwhelmed by but am glad I am coming to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's fresh in my mind, strategies for next year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick 1 - 3 strategic challenges you want to solve. Then identify 10 - 20 vendors that can help solve that problem. Talk to them, schedule appointments with them. Get more information than you know what to do with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on being a presenter. It will help check off that 'Speak in front of large groups of people' item on your &lt;em&gt;Bucket List&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conferences are always a bit overwhelming, but this one is more overwhelming than most. More than 40,000 people all gathered in one convention center to discuss Healthcare Tech. Kind of awesome and scary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to visiting some booths in the exhibition hall, and wandering around and stumbling onto some great new things / ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to write up my impressions of the days events, hopefully including notes, and links to tweets because the tweets will be raw and most uncensored impressions of what I'm seeing / hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the HIMSS 2017!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Conferences"></category><category term="HIMSS17"></category></entry></feed>
