I‚Äôve been a loyal OmniFocus user for about 5 years now, and though &lt;a href="/declaring-omnifocus-bankrupty.html"&gt;I have declared OmniFocus bankruptcy once&lt;/a&gt;, I still believe it‚Äôs a super useful App and I could not imagine life without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OmniFocus3 will bring with it tags which is something I‚Äôve really wanted and struggled without in using OmniFocus2. Sometimes things don‚Äôt just fall into pure GTD contexts and tags appear to be a recognition of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial release on May 30 is iOS only. The Mac Version is set to be released in 2018 but no firm date has been announced.&lt;/p&gt;

In this post I‚Äôll talk about my Review process which I adapted from David Allen‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt; methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several decisions that need to be made when reviewing email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is ‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="/rules-and-actions-in-outlook.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I spoke about my use of Rules and Custom Actions in Outlook. In this post I‚Äôll talk about my Review process which I adapted from David Allen‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt; methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several decisions that need to be made when reviewing email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this for me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it something that I need to do right now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the email is not for me then I need to decide who it is for. Once I have made that decision I &lt;strong&gt;Delegate&lt;/strong&gt; the responsibility of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will forward the email (or write up a new email with the salient details) and send it to the person that I‚Äôm delegating the responsibility to. But here‚Äôs the trick ‚Ä¶ I have a rule that if I put my email address in the BCC line it will be moved to a folder called &lt;code&gt;@waiting&lt;/code&gt; and flagged as a follow up item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then review the &lt;code&gt;@waiting&lt;/code&gt; folder once a day or every other day and will send a follow up email if needed OR delete the email once the person has responded to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next decision I need to make is ‚ÄúDo I need to do this &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;?‚Äù If I don‚Äôt, then I‚Äôll &lt;strong&gt;Defer&lt;/strong&gt; a response or action to the needed time. Unfortunately Outlook doesn‚Äôt have a good defer mechanism like my beloved &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/" title="OmniFocus ... The GTD App for iOS and MacOS"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;, so I will convert the email into a meeting and remove the attendees other than me to a data and time when I need to work on the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the email may require me to &lt;strong&gt;Do&lt;/strong&gt; something right now. In that case, I focus fully on the requirements of the email and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may involve scheduling a meeting, or supplying times when I‚Äôm available for a meeting, or it might be answering a question asked of me. I will do any necessary research OR as I start working on the email that requires a decision I‚Äôll discover that I don‚Äôt have enough information to actually make that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that happens I‚Äôll send an email (either forwarding or creating a new one) to the person I think that can supply the information and, you guessed it, I‚Äôll BCC myself so that the email is put into my &lt;code&gt;@waiting&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the above methodology I‚Äôm able to manage the massive amounts of email that I receive. Hopefully this helps someone out there who is drowning in email.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Rules and Actions in Outlook or How I stayed sane after coming back to 1000+ emails</title><link href="https://www.ryancheley.com/rules-and-actions-in-outlook.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-28T21:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-12-28T21:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>ryan</name></author><id>tag:www.ryancheley.com,2017-12-28:/rules-and-actions-in-outlook.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about the holidays is getting to take some time off and visit family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the worst things about the holidays is coming back to work and an inbox with more than 1200 emails. Granted, I was out of the office for 4 business days so it‚Äôs only about 300 emails per day, but still ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a lot^&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="ffn1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two strategies for dealing with the many emails I get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59" title="Rulz!"&gt;Outlook Rules&lt;/a&gt; (Rules)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-custom-actions-rules-in-Outlook-for-Windows-c6a15a50-5b4f-43ea-9bcf-be8616db8a98" title="Custom Actions"&gt;Outlook Custom Actions&lt;/a&gt; (Actions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules allow you to apply actions automatically as they are received in your inbox. This is useful if you work (or manage) one or more tech support desks and you need to segregate the email received into folders to review later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of thing that I do. I currently have more than 50 rules set up in Outlook and they help process about 50%-60% of the emails that I receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other 40% - 50% can‚Äôt be ‚ÄòRule‚Äô drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these types of emails I use Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions are amazing because they can have keyboard shortcuts assigned to them.^&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="ffn2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;^&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 3 Actions that I use consistently to help manage my email that isn‚Äôt automatically routed with Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive (Ctrl + Shift + 9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review (Ctrl + Shift + 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review with Boss (Ctrl + Shift + 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I archive all internal emails I receive, and probably about 90% of the external emails I receive so that I can refer back to them when needed. I have to archive them into a &lt;code&gt;.pst&lt;/code&gt; file because my IS department only allocates a finite (some might say &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; finite) amount of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Keyboard Shortcut &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Shift + 9&lt;/code&gt; will automatically move an email to the archive. This is really helpful for emails that were sent to me for informational purposes OR that have a long email chain and a resolution was reached without me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Review&lt;/code&gt; Action will mark the email with a Flag and move it to a &lt;code&gt;@Review&lt;/code&gt; folder. I do this with emails that will take more than 2 minutes to process. This works well for longer emails, or emails that need me to make a decision and I am not ready to make that decision yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Review with Boss&lt;/code&gt; action is the one action that is used the least of these three. It is useful when I receive an email and need guidance from my boss. If I just need to send her an email about it then I‚Äôll usually mark it as &lt;code&gt;Review&lt;/code&gt; and follow up with it during my review process or if it will take less than 2 minutes to write up an email I‚Äôll take care of it right then and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually emails to her take loner than 2 minutes to compose because they need to be short^&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="ffn3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;^&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my next post I‚Äôll go over my review process. This is where I go through the 25 - 100 emails that have been marked as &lt;code&gt;Review&lt;/code&gt; and answer the emails that need attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[I used to get even more. When my company upgraded to Exchange Server 2016 we got the ability for Out of Office Notifications to appear in a message BEFORE a person sent it. This has cut down on the amount of email I receive when I‚Äôm out of the office by about 30% - 50% &lt;a href="#ffn1"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;]{#fn1}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[If you‚Äôre not using keyboard shortcuts, you‚Äôre really missing out on some power user productivity hacks that will help you out. &lt;a href="#ffn2"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;]{#fn2}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[This idea is cribbed from Blaise Pascal‚Äôs statement, ‚ÄúJe n‚Äôai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n‚Äôai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte‚Äù ‚Ä¶ in English, ‚ÄúI have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.‚Äù Hat tip to &lt;a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter/"&gt;Quote Investigator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#ffn3"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;]{#fn3}&lt;/li&gt;

There are hundreds of legacy reports with legacy SQL code that has been written by 10‚Äôs of developers (some actual developers and some not so actual developers) over the last 10+ years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today a request came in to update a productivity report to include a new user. The request included their user ID from the application where their productivity is being tracked from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This request looked exactly like another report and request that I‚Äôve seen that involved running productivity from the same system with the same aspects (authorizations work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately thought that the reports were the same and set out to add the user id to a table &lt;code&gt;ReferralsTeam&lt;/code&gt; which includes fields &lt;code&gt;UserID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;USerName&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also thought that documenting what needed to be done for this would be a good thing to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I documented the fix and linked the &lt;code&gt;Confluece&lt;/code&gt; article to the &lt;code&gt;JIRA&lt;/code&gt; issue and then I realized my mistake. This wasn‚Äôt the same report. It wasn‚Äôt even the same department!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two reports that do &lt;strong&gt;EXCATLY&lt;/strong&gt; the same thing for two different departments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The report for the other department has user ids hard coded in the &lt;code&gt;SQL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy way is to just update the stored procedure with the hard coded user ids with the new one and call it a day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt; way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the table &lt;code&gt;ReferralsTeam&lt;/code&gt; to have a new column called department ... or better yet create a second table called &lt;code&gt;Departments&lt;/code&gt; with fields &lt;code&gt;DepartmentID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DepartmentName&lt;/code&gt; and add the &lt;code&gt;DepartmentID&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;ReferralsTeam&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Populate the new column with the correct data for the current team that has records in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the the various stored procedures that use the &lt;code&gt;ReferralsTeam&lt;/code&gt; table in them to include a parameter that is used to filter the new column that was added to keep the data consistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the User IDs from the report that has the user IDs hard coded, i.e. the &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; department&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the report that uses the hard coded user ids to use the dynamic stored procedure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify the results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a user interface to allow the data to be updated outside of &lt;code&gt;SQL Server Management Studio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give access to that user interface to the Department Managers so they can manage it on their own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, which one would you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I updated the hard coded stored procedure to include the new user id to get that part of the request done. This helps satisfy the requester and allows them to have the minimum amount of down time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then also create a new &lt;code&gt;JIRA&lt;/code&gt; issue so that we can look at doing steps 1 - 6 above and assigned to the report developer. Steps 7 &amp;amp; 8 are in a separate &lt;code&gt;JIRA&lt;/code&gt; issue that is assigned to the Web Developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing things the right way will sometimes take longer to implement in the short run, but in the long run we‚Äôve removed the need for Managers in these departments to ask to have the reports updated, we prevent bad/stale filters from being used, and we can eliminate a duplicative report!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting note, the reason I caught the duplication was because of a project that we‚Äôve been working on to document all of the hundreds of reports we have. I searched &lt;code&gt;Confluence&lt;/code&gt; for the report name and it‚Äôs recipients were unexpected for me. That lead me to question all I had done and really evaluate the best course of action. While I kind of went out of order (and this is why I started documented one process that I didn‚Äôt mean to) I was still able to catch my mistake and rectify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is a pain in the ass in the moment, but holy crap it can really pay off in unexpected ways in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category><category term="Design Decision"></category><category term="SQL"></category><category term="Technical Debt"></category></entry><entry><title>Declaring Omnifocus Bankrupty</title><link href="https://www.ryancheley.com/declaring-omnifocus-bankrupty.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-11-29T03:07:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-11-29T03:07:00+01:00</updated><author><name>ryan</name></author><id>tag:www.ryancheley.com,2016-11-29:/declaring-omnifocus-bankrupty.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been an on-again, off-again user of the &lt;a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com"&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt; methodology for several years now.

&lt;p&gt;I have always enjoyed how easy it is to sync between each of my devices using the Omni Sync Server so that my iPhone knows what changes I made on my iMac. It's pretty sweet, but lately I've gotten overwhelmed with the cruft in my Omnifocus database. So much so that I've actually stopped using OmniFocus as my GTD application of choice and have 'gone rogue' and am not using anything right now. Actually, I haven't used anything for several weeks now. It's starting to get to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I decided, the hell with it. I'm ignoring my 'todo' list anyway, why now just declare 'OmniFocus / GTD bankruptcy' and start the whole darn thing over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make 'all my troubles go away' I found &lt;a href="https://support.omnigroup.com/omnifocus-reset-database/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article on the &lt;a href="https://support.omnigroup.com/"&gt;OmniGroup's support forum&lt;/a&gt; ... which BTW is a great place for all things OmniFocus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using the instructions I found where the &lt;code&gt;ofocus&lt;/code&gt; file was located and changed it's name from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-172" height="115" src="/images/uploads/2016/11/OmniFocus-Original-300x115.png" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-171" height="114" src="/images/uploads/2016/11/OmniFocus-Updated-300x114.png" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I just followed the steps 5 - 11 and magically all of my tasks were gone. Just. Like. That.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I had to update my iOS OmniFocus, but that wasn't an issue. Just selected the 'Keep Sync Database' to over write the database on iOS and I was all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this loses ALL data, including the Contexts, and Perspectives, but I can create ones that I need easily enough. There's this guy called &lt;a href="https://www.macsparky.com"&gt;MacSparky&lt;/a&gt; that's kind of a savant about this stuff. I'm sure he's got a post or two that can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know that I'll do better this time, or that I won't just do this again in 6 months, or 12 months, or 5 years ... but for right now, it's what I need to do so I can get back to Getting Things Done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category><category term="GTD"></category><category term="OmniFocus"></category></entry></feed>
