&lt;p&gt;No. Really. Let. That. Sink. In.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Really. Let. That. Sink. In.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s more than the average &lt;a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2017-misc.shtml" title="Average attendance"&gt;attendance of a MLB game&lt;/a&gt; of 29 teams. It’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an introvert you know what will drain you and what will invigorate you. For me I need to be cautious of conferencing too hard. That is, I need to be aware of myself, my surroundings and my energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tips are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a great playlist on your smart phone. I use an iPhone and get a subscription to Apple Music just for the conference. This allows me to have a killer set of music that helps to drown out the cacophony of people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know when you’ve reached your limit. Even with some sweet tunes it’s easy to get drained. When you’re done you’re done. Don’t be a hero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to make at least one meaningful connection. I know, it’s hard. But it’s totally worth it. Other introverts are easy to spot because they’re the people on their smart phones pretending to write a blog post while listening to their sweet playlist. But if you can start a conversation, not small talk, it will be worth it. Attend a networking function that’s applicable to you and you’ll be able to find at least one or two people to connect with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other tips for surviving HIMSS are the same for any other conference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t worry about how you’re dressed ... you will &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; be underdressed when compared to Hospital Administrators ... you’re in ‘IT’ and you dress like it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear good walking shoes (see number 2 about being under dressed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink plenty of water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands and/or have hand sanitizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept free food when it’s offered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. One day down. 3+ more to go!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Conferenes"></category><category term="HIMSS18"></category></entry></feed>
