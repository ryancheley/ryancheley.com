I had already been through an issue where the an update like this was going to cause an issue, but I also knew what the fix &lt;a href="/fixing-a-pycharm-issue-when-updating-python-made-via-homebrew/" title="Homebrew and PyCharm don’t mix"&gt;was&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this knowledge in hand I happily performed the update. To my surprise, 2 things happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The update seemed to have me go from Python 3.7.6 to 3.7.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When trying to reestablish my &lt;code&gt;Virtual Environment&lt;/code&gt; two packages wouldn’t installed: &lt;code&gt;psycopg2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;django-heroku&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the update/backdate isn’t the end of the world. Quite honestly, next weekend I’m going to just ditch homebrew and go with the standard download from &lt;a href="https://www.python.org" title="Python"&gt;Python.org&lt;/a&gt; because I’m hoping that this non-sense won’t be an issue anymore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue was a bit more irritating though. I spent several hours trying to figure out what the problem was, only to find out, there wasn’t one really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘fix’ to the issue was to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open PyCharm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to ‘Project Interpreter’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the ‘+’ to add a package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for the package that wouldn’t install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click ‘Install Package’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viola ... &lt;a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/mischief-managed/"&gt;mischief managed&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;

I decided to really think about this question and see, what is it that I do with each device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought of each device as being its own ‘thing’. I did these things on my iPad Pro and those things on my MacBook Pro. But when I really sat down and thought about it, it turns out that there are things I do exclusively on my iPad Pro, and other things that I do exclusively on my MacBook Pro ... but there are also many things that I do on both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are apps which only run on iOS. Drafts is a perfect example. It’s my note taking app of choice. Using my iPhone in conjunction with my iPad makes Drafts one of the most powerful apps I use in the iOS ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During meetings I can quickly jot down things that I need to know using my iPhone and no one notices or cares. Later, I can use my iPad Pro to process these notes and make sure that everything gets taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can also use Drafts as a powerful automation tool to get ideas into OmniFocus (my To Do App of Choice) easily and without any fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also use my iPad Pro to process the expenses my family incurs. We use Siri Shortcuts to take a picture of a receipt which is then saved in a folder in Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I monitor these images and match them up against expenses (or income) in Mint and categorize the expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workflow helps to keep me (and my family) in the know about how (and more importantly where) we’re spending our money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mint is available as a web page, and I’ve tried to use macOS and this workflow, but it simply didn’t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using OmniFocus on the iPad is a dream. I am easily able to process my inbox, perform my weekly review and quickly add new items to do inbox. The ability to drag and drop with with either Apple Pencil or my finger makes it so easy to move tasks around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other (obvious) use case for my iPad Pro over my MacBook Pro is media consumption. Everyone says you can’t get real work done on an iPad and they point to how easy it is to consume media on the iPad, but I think that shows the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to take a break from doing real work, the best media consumption device is the one you have with you 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I really thought about what I use my MacBook Pro for I was ... surprised. Quite honestly, it’s used mostly to write code (in Python) using my favorite editor (PyCharm) but other than that ... I don’t do much on it that I can’t do on my iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I record podcast (OK, really, just that one and just that one time) I use my MBP, and if I have a ton of stuff I need to clean up in OmniFocus then I’m over at the MacBook, but really, it’s doesn’t do anything I can’t do on the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I don’t do real work in the macOS ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I do on both MacBook Pro and iPad Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, they both do a great job of getting me to where I want to go on the internet. Some people think that mobile safari isn’t up to it’s macOS counterpart (and they’re right) but for my (non-coding) needs, it doesn’t really matter to me. They both work really well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tend to use OmniFocus on both when I want to mark things as done, add new items, or make bulk edits (OF3 on iOS finally made this one a possibility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also use the terminal to access servers via ssh on both platforms. The great thing about the command line is that it’s mostly the same where ever you’re coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminus on iOS is a a great terminal app and I can just as easily navigate the server there as I can using the terminal app in macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also just as likely to plan my family’s budget on iOS as I am macOS. It just kind of depends which device is easier to get to, not what I’m planning on doing. Excel on both platforms works really well for me (I work in a Windows environment professionally so Excel is what I use and know for that kind of thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, writing. I use Ulysses on both macOS and iOS and really, I love them both. Each app has parity with the other so I never feel like I’m losing something when I write on my MacBook Pro (or on my iPad Pro). Sometimes, it’s hard to really tell which platform I’m on because they do such a good job (for me) to make them basically the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I don’t think it’s a question of which to choose, iPad Pro or MacBook Pro, iOS or macOS ... it’s a matter of what device is closest to me right now? What device will bring me the most joy to use, right now? What device do I want to use right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS or macOS? iPad Pro or MacBook Pro? These aren’t the right questions to be asking. It should be ... what device do I want to use right now? And don’t care what anyone else thinks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="macOS"></category><category term="iOS"></category><category term="iPad"></category><category term="MacBook Pro"></category><category term="macOS"></category></entry><entry><title>Moving my Pycharm Directory or How I spent my Saturday after jacking up my PyCharm environment</title><link href="https://www.ryancheley.com/moving-my-pycharm-directory-or-how-i-spent-my-saturday-after-jacking-up-my-pycharm-environment.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-12T15:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-08-12T15:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>ryan</name></author><id>tag:www.ryancheley.com,2018-08-12:/moving-my-pycharm-directory-or-how-i-spent-my-saturday-after-jacking-up-my-pycharm-environment.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while I get a wild hair and decide that I need to ‘clean up’ my directories.

This &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; ends well and I almost always mess up something, but I still do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? I’m not sure, except that I &lt;em&gt;forget&lt;/em&gt; that I’ll screw it up. 🤦‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on a Saturday morning when I had nothing but time I decided that I’d move my PyCharm directory from /Users/ryan/PyCharm to /Users/ryan/Documents/PyCharm for no other reason than &lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I proceeded to use the command line to move the folder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;mv /Users/ryan/PyCharm/ /Users/ryan/Documents/PyCharm/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing too big, right. Just a simple file movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so much. I then tried to open a project in PyCharm and it promptly freaked out. Since I use virtual environments for my Python Project AND they tend to have paths that reference where they exist, suddenly ALL of my virtual environments were kind of just &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. No big deal. I just undid my move&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;mv /Users/ryan/Documents/PyCharm/ /Users/ryan/PyCharm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should fix me up, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, mostly. I had to re-register the virtual environments and reinstall all of the packages in my projects (mostly not a big deal with PyCharm) but holy crap it was scary. I thought I had hosed my entire set of projects (not that I have anything that’s critical … but still).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is mostly a note to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you get a wild hair to move stuff around, just keep it where it is. There’s no reason for it (unless there is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, ask yourself first, “If I don’t move this what will happen?” If the answer is anything less than “Something awful” go watch a baseball game, or go to the pool, or write some code. Don’t mess with your environment unless you really want to spend a couple of hours unmasking it up!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="macOS"></category><category term="MacBook Pro"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>My Mac session with Apple</title><link href="https://www.ryancheley.com/my-mac-session-with-apple.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-27T21:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-12-27T21:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>ryan</name></author><id>tag:www.ryancheley.com,2017-12-27:/my-mac-session-with-apple.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For Christmas I bought myself a 2017 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A \$150 Apple Gift Card because I bought the MacBook Pro on Black Friday and Apple had a special going (w00t!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Credit Card I use to make &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; of my purchases at Apple has a 3% cash back (in the form of iTunes cards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A free 30 minute online / phone session with an ‘Apple Specialist’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I didn’t know about item number 3 when I made the purchase, but was greeted with an email informing me of my great luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my fifth Mac^&lt;a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="ffn1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;^ and I don’t remember ever getting this kind of service before. So I figured, what the hell and decided to snooze the email until the day after Christmas to remind myself to sign up for the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I entered the session I was asked to optionally provide some information about myself. I indicated that I had been using a Mac for several years and considered myself an intermediate user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Apple ‘Specialist’ was &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="No ... not that one"&gt;Jaime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. She confirmed the optional notes that I entered and we were off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a lot of what she told me about Safari (blocking creepy tracking behavior, ability to mute sound from auto play videos, default site to display in reader view) I knew from the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/101/" title="WWDC Keynote"&gt;WWDC Keynote&lt;/a&gt; that I watched back in June, but I listened just in case I had missed something from that session (or the &lt;a href="https://relay.fm" title="All the Great Shows!"&gt;10s / 100s of hours of podcasts&lt;/a&gt; I listened to about the Keynote).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I had heard about was the ability to &lt;em&gt;pin&lt;/em&gt; tabs in Safari. I never really knew what that meant and figured it wasn’t anything that I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wrong. Holy crap is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ssw5MKAno" title="Pinning Tabs!"&gt;pinning tabs in Safari&lt;/a&gt; a useful feature! I can keep all of my most used sites pinned and get to them really quickly and they get auto refreshed! Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other super useful thing I found out about was the &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948" title="Split your screen ... increase your productivity"&gt;Split Screen&lt;/a&gt; feature that allows you to split apps on your screen (in a very iOS-y way!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Jaime reviewed how to customize the touch bar! This one was super useful as I think there are 2 discoverability issues with it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The option to &lt;code&gt;Customize Touch Bar&lt;/code&gt; is hidden in the &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; menu which isn’t somewhere I’d look for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207055" title="Customization!"&gt;Customize the Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt; you drag down from the Main Screen onto the Touch Bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the call I received a nice follow up email from Apple / Jaime&lt;/p&gt;

They offer memberships and after listening to hours and hours of &lt;em&gt;All The Great Shows&lt;/em&gt; I decided that I needed to become a &lt;a href="https://www.relay.fm/membership"&gt;member&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the awesome perks of &lt;a href="http://www.relay.fm"&gt;Relay&lt;/a&gt; membership is a set of &lt;strong&gt;Amazing&lt;/strong&gt; background images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fortuitous as I've been looking for some good backgrounds for my iMac, and so it seemed like a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my iMac I have several &lt;code&gt;spaces&lt;/code&gt; configured. One for &lt;code&gt;Writing&lt;/code&gt;, one for &lt;code&gt;Podcast&lt;/code&gt; and one for everything else. I wanted to take the backgrounds from Relay and have them on the &lt;code&gt;Writing&lt;/code&gt; space and the &lt;code&gt;Podcasting&lt;/code&gt; space, but I also wanted to be able to distinguish between them. One thing I could try to do would be to open up an image editor (Like &lt;a href="http://www.photoshop.com"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/pro/"&gt;Pixelmater&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/"&gt;Acorn&lt;/a&gt;) and add text to them one at a time (although I'm sure there is a way to script them) but I decided to see if I could do it using Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code will take the background images from my &lt;code&gt;/Users/Ryan/Relay 5K Backgrounds/&lt;/code&gt; directory and spit them out into a subdirectory called &lt;code&gt;Podcasting&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;PIL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ImageStat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ImageFont&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ImageDraw&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;listdir&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was great, but it included all of the images, and some of them are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bright. I mean, like &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to use &lt;a href="http://www.ryancheley.com/blog/2016/12/17/its-science"&gt;something I learned while helping my daughter with her Science Project last year&lt;/a&gt; and determine the brightness of the images and use only the dark ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lead me to update the code to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;PIL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ImageStat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ImageFont&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ImageDraw&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;listdir&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os.path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;isfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;brightness01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;im_file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="n"&gt;im&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;im_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;convert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;L&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="n"&gt;stat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ImageStat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Stat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;im&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to have backgrounds generated for my &lt;strong&gt;Writing&lt;/strong&gt; space, so I tacked on this code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;darkimagesrows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TextXPos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TextYPos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Writing&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TextFontColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/Users/Ryan/Relay 5K Backgrounds/Writing/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;darkimages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/Users/Ryan/Relay 5K Backgrounds/Writing/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;darkimages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39; succesfully saved!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statements at the end of the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops were so that I could tell that something was actually happening. The images were VERY large (close to 10MB for each one) so the &lt;code&gt;PIL&lt;/code&gt; library was taking some time to process the data and I was concerned that something had frozen / stopped working&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty straightforward project, but it was pretty fun. It allowed me to go from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-121" height="169" src="/images/uploads/2017/09/Cortex-5K-small-original-300x169.png" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-122" height="169" src="/images/uploads/2017/09/Cortex-5K-small-300x169.png" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the text attributes I had to play around with them for a while until I found the color, font and font size that I liked and looked good (to me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Positioning of the text also took a bit of experimentation, but a little trial and error and I was all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for the &lt;code&gt;brightness&lt;/code&gt; level of 65 I just looked at the images that seemed to work and found a threshold to use. The actual value may vary depending on the look you're doing for.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="macOS"></category></entry><entry><title>Home, End, PgUp, PgDn ...

One of the things that has been tripping me up though are my 'Windows' tendencies on the keyboard. Specifically, my muscle memory of the use and behavior of the &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;End&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PgUp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PgDn&lt;/code&gt; keys. The default behavior for these keys in BBEdit are not what I needed (nor wanted). I lived with it for a couple of days figuring I'd get used to it and that would be that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While driving home from work today I was listening to &lt;a href="https://atp.fm/episodes/196"&gt;ATP Episode 196&lt;/a&gt; and their Post-Show discussion of the recent departure of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal_Soghoian"&gt;Sal Soghoian&lt;/a&gt; who was the Project Manager for the macOS automation. I'm not sure why, but suddenly it clicked with me that I could probably change the behavior of the keys through the Preferences for the Keyboard (either system wide, or just in the Application).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got home I fired up &lt;a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html"&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt; and jumped into the preferences and saw this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-110" height="273" src="/images/uploads/2017/12/BBEdit-Default-Keyboard-Preferences-300x273.png" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a couple of changes, and now the keys that I use to navigate through the text editor are now how I want them to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-111" height="270" src="/images/uploads/2017/12/BBEdit-Ryans-Keyboard-Preferences-300x270.png" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing too fancy, or anything, but goodness, does it feel right to have the keys work the way I need them to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="macOS"></category><category term="BBEdit"></category><category term="macOS"></category><category term="preferences"></category></entry></feed>
