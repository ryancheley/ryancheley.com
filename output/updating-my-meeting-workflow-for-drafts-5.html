</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Drafts is a <strong>productivity</strong> app created by Greg Pierce (\@AgileTortoise).</p>
<p>I’ve loved and used Drafts 4 every day for the last several years. I loved it so much I even contributed to the Tip Jar Greg had in the app. Seriously, it’s an amazing app. If you haven’t <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8">downloaded</a> it already you totally should.</p>
<p>Recently, Greg released Drafts 5. With this new version comes a new Business Model as well. Instead of a single pay (and hope people ‘tip’ you) he’s converted to a subscription model.</p>
<p>I signed up for the free week and didn’t have a real opportunity to use it before my free week was converted into a pay week but I’ve no regrets. I like what Greg does and want him to keep updating his app so that I can get the benefits of it once I have a real chance to dive in.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I wasn’t able to really use the new version is the way that I primarily use Drafts. I have a <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/fe54a103d8a94faaa5784510001e374e">WorkFlow</a> that takes a meeting on my work calendar and allows me to take notes about that meetings.</p>
<p>It’s one of the most useful <strong>productivity</strong> tools I have during my morning standup meetings with my team, and it’s useful for the other (sometimes endless) meetings that I go to.</p>
<p>With the release of Drafts 5 I was not longer able to use both Drafts 5 AND my workflow, so I needed to update my workflow.</p>
<p>With Drafts 4 it was just one of the built in Apps. Because Drafts 5 limits some of the functionality unless you have the <em>PRO</em> version I don’t think that Workflow will be updated to include Drafts 5 like it did Drafts 4.</p>
<p>Once I realized that <em>AND</em> since I’m paying for the app I figured I’d need to update my Workflow instead of waiting and hoping that Workflow would be updated to include Drafts 5.</p>
<p>In order to make the update I had to look for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/app-uri/">URL Scheme</a> for Drafts 5 ... but I couldn’t really find one. I assumed that Drafts 5 URL Scheme would be the same as <a href="https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202771400-Drafts-URL-Schemes">Drafts 4</a> (I was right) and made various attempts at getting a copy of the Workflow to work with Drafts 5.</p>
<p>This is the section of the workflow that needs to be updated:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-282" height="388" src="/images/uploads/2018/05/Image-5-19-18-6-37-PM.png" width="1619"></p>
<p>Since Drafts 5 isn’t included in the Built in Apps I was going to need to pass a URL and open the app.</p>
<p>This would require 3 separate steps in Workflow</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert Text into URL Encoded string</li>
<li>Prepend the URL Scheme for creating a new draft to the URL Encoded String</li>
<li>Open the URL</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-283" height="1490" src="/images/uploads/2018/05/Image-5-19-18-6-37-PM-1.png" width="1622"></p>
<p>This basically means that 1 step is now replaced with 3 ... but hey, that’s the price of progress must be paid!</p>
<p>Both the <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/fe54a103d8a94faaa5784510001e374e">Drafts 4</a> and <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/dae8898da2c34dcf9eee099c333e749d">Drafts 5</a> versions of these workflows are available.</p>
