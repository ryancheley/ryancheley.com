</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>For Christmas I bought myself a 2017 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Several bonuses were associated with the purchase:</p>
<ol>
<li>A \$150 Apple Gift Card because I bought the MacBook Pro on Black Friday and Apple had a special going (w00t!)</li>
<li>The Credit Card I use to make <strong>ALL</strong> of my purchases at Apple has a 3% cash back (in the form of iTunes cards)</li>
<li>A free 30 minute online / phone session with an ‘Apple Specialist’</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I didn’t know about item number 3 when I made the purchase, but was greeted with an email informing me of my great luck.</p>
<p>This is my fifth Mac^<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="ffn1">1</a>^ and I don’t remember ever getting this kind of service before. So I figured, what the hell and decided to snooze the email until the day after Christmas to remind myself to sign up for the session.</p>
<p>When I entered the session I was asked to optionally provide some information about myself. I indicated that I had been using a Mac for several years and considered myself an intermediate user.</p>
<p>My Apple ‘Specialist’ was <em><a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="No ... not that one">Jaime</a></em>. She confirmed the optional notes that I entered and we were off to the races.</p>
<p>Now a lot of what she told me about Safari (blocking creepy tracking behavior, ability to mute sound from auto play videos, default site to display in reader view) I knew from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/101/" title="WWDC Keynote">WWDC Keynote</a> that I watched back in June, but I listened just in case I had missed something from that session (or the <a href="https://relay.fm" title="All the Great Shows!">10s / 100s of hours of podcasts</a> I listened to about the Keynote).</p>
<p>One thing that I had heard about was the ability to <em>pin</em> tabs in Safari. I never really knew what that meant and figured it wasn’t anything that I needed.</p>
<p>I was wrong. Holy crap is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ssw5MKAno" title="Pinning Tabs!">pinning tabs in Safari</a> a useful feature! I can keep all of my most used sites pinned and get to them really quickly and they get auto refreshed! Sweet!</p>
<p>The other super useful thing I found out about was the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948" title="Split your screen ... increase your productivity">Split Screen</a> feature that allows you to split apps on your screen (in a very iOS-y way!).</p>
<p>Finally, Jaime reviewed how to customize the touch bar! This one was super useful as I think there are 2 discoverability issues with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>The option to <code>Customize Touch Bar</code> is hidden in the <code>View</code> menu which isn’t somewhere I’d look for it</li>
<li>To <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207055" title="Customization!">Customize the Touch Bar</a> you drag down from the Main Screen onto the Touch Bar.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the call I received a nice follow up email from Apple / Jaime</p>
