</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last September the annual Django Con was held in San Diego. I <strong>really</strong> wanted to go, but because of other projects and conferences for my job, I wasn’t able to make it.</p>
<p>The next best thing to to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2NFhrDSOxgXXUMIGOs8lNe2B-f4pXOX-">videos from DjangoCon on YouTube</a>. I watched a couple of the videos, but one that really caught my attention was by <a href="https://github.com/carltongibson">Carlton Gibson</a> titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjTRSH0pNBo">Your Web Framework Needs You: An Update by Carlton Gibson</a>”.</p>
<p>I took what Carlton said to heart and thought, I really should be able to do <em>something</em> to help.</p>
<p>I went to the <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/">Django Issues site</a> and searched for an <strong>Easy Pickings</strong> issue that involved documentation and found <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31006">issue 31006 “Document how to escape a date/time format character for the |date and |time filters.”</a></p>
<p>I read the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/working-with-git/#publishing-work">steps on what I needed to do to submit a pull request</a>, but since it was my first time <strong>ever</strong> participating like this … I was a bit lost.</p>
<p>Luckily there isn’t anything that you can break, so I was able to wonder around for a bit and get my bearings.</p>
<p>I forked the GitHub repo and I cloned it locally.</p>
<p>I then spent an <strong>embarasingly</strong> long time trying to figure out where the change was going to need to be made, and exactly what needed to change.</p>
<p>Finally, with my changes made, I <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/12128#issue-344767579">pushed my code changes</a> to GitHub and waited.</p>
<p>Within a few hours <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/12128#issuecomment-557804299">Mariusz Felisiak replied back</a> and asked about a suggestion he had made (but which I missed). I dug back into the documentation, found what he was referring to, and made (what I thought) was his suggested change.</p>
<p>Another push and a bit more waiting.</p>
<p>Mariusz Felisiak replied back with some input about the change I pushed up, and I realized I had missed the mark on what he was suggesting.</p>
<p>OK. <a href="#">Third time’s a charm</a>, right?</p>
<p>Turns out, in this case it was. <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/12128#issuecomment-560278417">I pushed up one last time</a> and this time, my changes were <a href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/cd7f48e85e3e4b9f13df6c0ef5f1d95abc079ff6#diff-7be9aaef6dad344e74188264c0e95daa">merged</a> into the master and just like that, I am now a contributor to Django (albeit a very, very, very minor contributor).</p>
<p>Overall, this was a great experience, both with respect to learning about contributing to an open source project, as well as learning about GitHub.</p>
<p>I’m hoping that with the holidays upon us I’ll be able to find the time to pick up one or two (maybe even three) <strong>Easy Pickings</strong> issues from the Django issue tracker.</p>
