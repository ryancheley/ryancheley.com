</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I walked into the testing center at 8:30 (a full 30 minutes before my exam start time as the email suggested I do).</p>
<p>I signed in and was given a key for a locker for my belongings and offered use of the restroom.</p>
<p>I was then asked to read some forms and then was processed. My pockets were turned out and my glasses inspected. I signed in (again) and had the signature on my ID scrutinized with how I signed on test day. It only took three tries ... apparently 19 year old me doesn’t sign his name like 39 year old me.</p>
<p>Now it was test time ... even if I could remember any of the questions I wouldn’t be able to write about them ... but I can’t remember them so it’s not a problem.</p>
<p>It took me 80 minutes to get through the real test of 115 questions (15 are there as ‘test’ questions that don’t actually count). The only real issues I had were:</p>
<ul>
<li>construction noise outside the window to my left</li>
<li>the <em>burping</em> guy to my right ... seriously bro, cut down on the breakfast burritos</li>
<li>one question that I read incorrectly 4 different times. On the fifth time I finally realized my mistake and was able to answer correctly (I think). As it turned out I had guessed what I thought was the correct answer but it was still a good feeling to get the number through a calculation instead of just guessing it</li>
</ul>
<p>When the test was completed and my questions scored the results came back. A passing score is 600 out of 800. I scored 669 ... I am officially CPHIMS. The scoring breakdown even shows areas where I didn’t do so well, so I know what to focus on for the future. For reference, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing and Evaluation (which is surprising for me)</li>
<li>Analysis (again, surprising)</li>
<li>Privacy and Security (kind of figured this as it’s not part of my everyday job)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>When I set this goal for myself at the beginning of the year it was just something that I wanted to do. I didn’t really have a reason for it other than I thought it might be <em>neat</em>.</p>
<p>After passing the exam I am really glad that I did. I’ve heard myself say things and think about things differently, like implementation using <em>Pilots</em> versus <em>Big Bang</em> or <em>By Location</em> versus <em>By Feature</em>.</p>
<p>I’m also asking questions differently of my colleagues and my supervisors to help ensure that the we are doing things for the right reason at the right time.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see what I try to do next</p>                </article>
