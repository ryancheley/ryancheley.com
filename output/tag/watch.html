<h2>The first week</h2>
<p>I've been rocking a series 2 Apple Watch for about 18 months. I timed my purchase just right to not get a series 3 when it went on sale (ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). When the series 4 was released I decided that I wanted to get one, but was a bit too slow (and tired) to stay up and order one at launch.</p>
<p>This meant that I didn't get my new Apple Watch until last Saturday (nearly5 weeks later). I wanted to write down my thoughts on the Ô£ø Watch and what it's meant for me. I won't go into specs and details, just what I've found that I liked and didn't like.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>Holy crap is it fast. I mean, like really fast. I've never had a watch that responded like this (before my series 2 I had a series 0).</p>
<p>It reacts when I want it to, so much so that I'm sometimes not prepared. It reminds me of the transition from Touch ID Gen 1 to Touch ID Gen 2. I really appreciate how fast everything comes up. When I start an activity, it‚Äôs there (no more waiting like on Series 2). When I want to pair with my AirPods ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs there and ready to go.</p>
<p>I also really like how much thinner it is and the increase in size. At first I thought it was ‚Äòmonstrous‚Äô but now I‚Äôm trying to figure out how I ever lived with 2 fewer millimeters.</p>
<p>I also decided to get the Cellular Version just in case. It was a bit more expensive, and I probably won‚Äôt end up using it past the free trial I got, but it‚Äôs nice to know that I can have it if I need it. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to use it (yet) but hopefully I‚Äôll get a chance here soon.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>So far, nothing has stuck me as being ‚Äòbad‚Äô. It‚Äôs the first Apple Watch I‚Äôve had that‚Äôs really exceeded my expectations in terms of performance and sheer joy that I get out of using it.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall I <strong>love</strong> the Series 4 Ô£ø Watch. It doesn‚Äôt do anything different than the Series 2 that I had (except I can make phone calls without my phone if I need to) but <em>oh my</em> is it fast! If someone is on a Series 2 and is wondering if jumping to the Series 4 is worth it ‚Ä¶ it totally is.</p>                </article>
