</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>One thing I like to do with my family is watch movies. But not just any movies, Comic Book movies. We've seen both <a href="https://itun.es/us/ieifP">Thor</a> and <a href="https://itun.es/us/7tLNR">Thor: The Dark World</a>, <a href="https://itun.es/us/sLibP">Iron Man</a> and <a href="https://itun.es/us/KoVM1">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. It's not a lot, but we're working on it.</p>
<p>I've mapped out the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> movies for us to watch, and it's OK, but there wasn't a easy way to link into the iTunes store from the list.</p>
<p>I decided that I could probably use <a href="https://appsto.re/us/2IzJ2.i">Workflow</a> to do this, but I hadn't really worked with it to do it, but today I had a bit of time and figured, "what they heck ... why not?"</p>
<p>My initial attempt was clunky. It required to workflows to accomplish what I needed. This was because I had to split the work of <a href="https://appsto.re/us/2IzJ2.i">Workflow</a> into 2 workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the Name</li>
<li>Get the Link</li>
</ul>
<p>Turns out there's a much easier way, so I'll post the link to that workflow, and not the workflows that are much harder to use!</p>
<p>The workflow <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/66f269ed34cb42469df4de8dcb7739e7">Add Movie to Watch</a> accepts <code>iTunes products</code>. The workflow then does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It saves the <code>iTunes products</code> URL as a variable called <code>iTunes</code></li>
<li>It then gets the <code>iTunes</code> variable to retrieve the <code>Name</code> and sets the value to a variable called <code>Movie</code></li>
<li>Next it asks 'Who is the movie being added by?' This is important for my family as we want a common list, but it's also good to know who added the movie!</li>
<li>This value is saved to a variable called <code>User</code></li>
<li>Finally, I want to know when the movie was added so I get the current date.</li>
</ul>
<p>We take all of the items and construct a bit of <code>text</code> that looks like this:</p>
<p><code>[{Movie}]({iTunes}) - Added on {Input} by {User}</code></p>
<p>Where each of the words above surrounded by the {} are the variable names previously mentioned ({Input} is from the get current date and doesn't need to be saved to a variable).</p>
<p>In my last step I take this text and append it to a file in Dropbox called <code>Movies to Watch.md</code>.</p>
<p>It took <strong>way</strong> longer than I would have liked to finish this up, but at the end of the day, I'm glad that I was able to get it done.</p>
