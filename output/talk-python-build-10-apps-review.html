</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Michael Kennedy over at Talk Python had a sale on his courses over the holidays so I took the plunge and bought them all. I have been listening to the podcast for several months now so I knew that I wouldn’t mind listening to him talk during a course (which is important!).</p>
<p>The first course I watched was ‘Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps’. The apps were:</p>
<ul>
<li>App 1: Hello (you Pythonic) world</li>
<li>App 2: Guess that number game</li>
<li>App 3: Birthday countdown app</li>
<li>App 4: Journal app and file I/O</li>
<li>App 5: Real-time weather client</li>
<li>App 6: LOLCat Factory</li>
<li>App 7: Wizard Battle App</li>
<li>App 8: File Searcher App</li>
<li>App 9: Real Estate Analysis App</li>
<li>App 10: Movie Search App</li>
</ul>
<p>For each app you learn a specific set of skills related to either Python or writing ‘Pyhonic’ code. I think the best part was that since it was all self paced I was able to spend time where I wanted to exploring ideas and concepts that wouldn’t have been available in traditional classrooms.</p>
<p>Also, since I’m fully adulted it can be hard to find time to watch and interact with courses like this so being able to watch them when I wanted to was a bonus.</p>
<p>Hello (you Pythonic) world is what you would expect from any introductory course. You write the basic ‘Hello World’ script, but with a twist. For this app you interact with it so that it asks your name and then it will output ‘Hello username my name is HAL!’ … although because I am who I am HAL wasn’t the name in the course, it was jut the name I chose for the app.</p>
<p>My favorite app to build and use was the Wizard App (app 7). It is a text adventure influenced by dungeons and dragons and teaches about classes and inheritance an polymorphism. It ws pretty cool.</p>
<p>The version that you are taught to make only has 4 creatures and ends pretty quickly. I enhanced the game to have it randomly create up to 250 creatures (some of them poisonous) and you level up during the game so that you can feel like a real character in an RPG.</p>
<p>The journal application was interesting because I finally started to get my head wrapped around file I/o. I’m not sure why I’ve had such a difficult time internalizing the concept, but the course seemed to help me better understand what was going on in terms of file streaming and reading data to do a thing.</p>
<p>My overall experience with the course was super positive. I’m really glad that I watched it and have already started to try to use the things that I’ve learned to improve code I’ve previously written.</p>
<p>With all of the good, there is some not so good.</p>
<p>The course uses it’s own player, which is fine, but it’s missing some key features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Time reaming</li>
<li>Speed controls (i.e. it only plays at one speed, 1x)</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, sometimes the player would need to be reloaded which could be frustrating.</p>
<p>Overall though it was a great course and I’m glad I was able to do it.</p>
<p>Next course: Mastering PyCharm!</p>
