</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>On Sundays mornings I wake up pretty early, make myself some coffee and read through all of the interesting articles I came across during the week (usually from <a href="https://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>).</p>
<p>Last weekend I came across an article, <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/you-probably-know-to-ask-yourself-what-do-i-want-here-s-a-way-better-question-1149529539">You probably know to ask yourself, “What do I want?” Here’s a way better question</a></p>
<p>I was struck by several passages in the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you find yourself wanting something month after month, year after year, yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it, then maybe what you actually want is a fantasy, an idealization, an image and a false promise. Maybe what you want isn’t what you want, you just enjoy wanting. Maybe you don’t actually want it at all.</p>
<p>I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love not with the fight but only the victory. And life doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p>This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. So choose your struggles wisely, my friend.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was younger I wanted to be many things, a Physicist, an Archtect, an Engineer, a Professor ... but none of those things ever got any closer. I'd be really engaged in the ideas of one of these for weeks or months at a time.</p>
<p>I remember being so enamoured with the idea of Civil Engineering I convinced my parents to get me a drafting board that I had in my room and I used to 'design' a prototype of a Martian Habitat.</p>
<p>But, as soon as I got bored I would move onto something else. From Physics to Archtecture to Engineering and back to Physics. I would always stop when it either got too hard <strong>OR</strong> something else looked more interesting.</p>
<p>I was always awed by my peers that could stay laser focused on a single hobby or dream job and was amazed at the amount of sacrifice they would be willing to make in order to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I got to college when I started to see what I needed to sacrifice in order to get ahead.</p>
<p>Parties on the weekend. Not for me ... I had a full time job and was a full time student. I would hang with friends when I could, but I was mostly at the library studying, or at work studying or maybe getting a little bit of sleep.</p>
<p>I suddenly became laser focused like the people I knew in high school. I had a single goal and that was to graduate and go onto graduate school so I could get a PhD in economics.</p>
<p>The PhD didn't happen, and in the following years I felt like I did in high school ... becoming very interested in a 'thing' and then moving on from it because I'd get bored.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled into the Healthcare Industry and it all came back. An ability to be laser focused on new and interesting things. Wanting (maybe needing) to learn everything I could about Healthcare.</p>
<p>It's been more than 8 years since I started on my journey, and I've struggled every time I've started to learn a new aspect of the industry, or just an aspect of a new job that I had started.</p>
<p>And that's when the final passage in the article really hit me like a ton of bricks:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. So choose your struggles wisely, my friend.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It truly is the struggle that determines the success. I've struggled mightily while working in healthcare, but those struggles have lead to the most fulfilling and successful career I could have hoped for.</p>
